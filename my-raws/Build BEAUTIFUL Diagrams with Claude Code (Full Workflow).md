# Build BEAUTIFUL Diagrams with Claude Code (Full Workflow)

Most people are visual learners. I am
myself, you probably are watching this
video. The problem is coding agents like
Claude Code are not very visual tools.
When you want it to explain something to
you visually, or even just help you
explain something to someone else, they
really don't do a good job unless you do
a lot of prompting and give it the right
abilities. And that is what I have been
working on. So, I love using Excalidraw
for all of my diagrams. You've seen this
before if you've been on my channel or
in the Dynamis community. I build dozens
of these every single month. And so,
I've taken my entire workflow and I've
packaged it up into a skill so I can use
Claude Code or any coding agent to help
me build all these beautiful and
practical diagrams. And so, giving my
coding agent the ability to argue
visually. And so, right now, I want to
share this skill with you. My entire
process packaged up so you can use it
right now. So, I will have a link in the
description to this GitHub repository.
This has everything for the Ex- calidraw
diagram skill. It is pretty simple
overall. So, you just clone this
repository and then you create a new
folder in your .claude/skills
or whatever it is for your coding agent
and then you just copy over everything
from this. And it is going to work no
matter your coding agent. So, I'll show
you my setup really quickly here. I have
my .claude skills directory. I created a
new folder called Excalidraw diagram and
then I just dumped in everything from
the repo including the skill.md. This is
the primary instruction set that guides
Claude Code how to argue visually,
creating the JSON files for these
Excalidraw diagrams. And I know this is
super meta, but I used the Excalidraw
diagram skill to create this diagram to
explain the workflow to you so you
understand how it works. And I iterated
a couple of times to get to this point,
but this is the kind of thing that you
can generate with this skill. All you
have to do, I'll show you a really quick
demo of this right now. It's going to
Claude Code and just say, "Hey, I want
to create a diagram to explain." and
then I could just like give the path to
this file for example. You could also
give it the path to maybe like a YouTube
script. I do that all the time to help
with my YouTube videos. You can have it
build a diagram based on a PDF document.
Like it can be literally anything. So
you just send in this prompt and then
Claude code or whatever coding agent is
going to be smart enough to know like,
"Okay, let me go ahead and load in the
skill." And that brings in the entire
workflow. So basically we're giving it a
very articulate prompt how to generate
the diagram and validate it as well. And
once your coding agent outputs the JSON
for the Excalidraw diagram, you can just
go to excalidraw.com
and load it from your local file system.
Or you can use the Excalidraw plugin in
Obsidian. Both are very valid and
excalidraw.com is entirely free. So very
easy to render these diagrams once you
have them. And my favorite part about
this workflow is not only does it create
the Excalidraw diagram, but it also
validates it visually. So it will render
the diagram, take a screenshot, look at
the PNG, and then iterate on any of the
imperfections. And I just get insane
results with this workflow when we have
this self-validation. Cuz like I said
earlier, coding agents are not the best
at visual tasks. They need the ability
to check their own work and we can do
that with Excalidraw. So I'll show you
an example really quick of an image that
it rendered after it built the diagram.
So it's looking at this directly to see
if there's anything off with the visual
flow, the hierarchy of information, all
the things that I have prompted into the
skill.md. And it uses a Python script in
order to do this rendering, which that's
really the only setup that we have for
the skill. So I cover that in the read
me here, but honestly the easiest thing
is you can just ask your coding agent to
help you set up the Excalidraw diagram
skill. Because then it knows to read the
read me and it'll pretty much just go
through the manual steps on its own. So
that by the time it's your turn to use
the skill, everything is all good to go,
and you can just simply ask it to build
any kind of diagram like I showed in the
simple demo earlier. Now, one very
important thing to keep in mind, no
matter how well-designed this Excalidraw
skill is, and I have been iterating on
it constantly, it is not going to be a
perfect. For example, this meta diagram
here that explains the workflow, it took
me two or three iterations to get to
this point. This is the original diagram
that the skill with Claude code produced
for me, which it still looks pretty
good, but you can see there are a couple
of imperfections here. Like I feel like
the arrows look a little jank, for lack
of better words. This arrow is too
short. I don't quite like the colors. I
feel like there's not enough information
displayed here. So, I have my critiques,
and it's very easy though to iterate on
this. Just a couple of directed updates
with my help to get to the point where
we have something more like this. Now,
the reason that it's never perfect at
first, it actually makes sense when you
think about how much the large language
model has to produce for this diagram.
Cuz think about this, it has to decide
every color, every shape, the entire
layout, the position of everything.
There's so many micro decisions going
into creating just this single, rather
simple diagram. And so, it's always
going to be imperfect, but it's easy to
get to this point. That's the important
thing is getting the starting point with
this skill for you to apply your own
reasoning for how you want it to evolve
and the exact information that you want
to display. Cool. So, the last thing
that I want to cover with you is the
workflow, at least at a high level,
especially so you know how to customize
it to your own liking. We'll also talk
about the color palette. That's one of
the most important things to make the
diagrams on brand to you, or just the
color scheme that you like using. So,
the core philosophy that I have built a
lot of prompting around in the skill.md
is teaching the coding agent how to
argue visually. So, explaining that like
we don't just want to put things in a
bunch of blocks cuz when it generates
Excalidraw diagrams without this skill,
it's very blocky for lack of better
words. But instead, we want to argue
visually. We want the structure and
labels to explain the entire concept. So
even if we strip out all of the
explanatory text from the diagram like
this, we would still be able to
understand what we are arguing visually
in the diagram. And so there are two
main questions that I have the coding
agent ask itself in the workflow. First,
does the visual structure mirror the
concept's behavior? And then also could
someone learn something concrete from
this diagram? I'm very educational
focused on my YouTube channel, as you
probably know. So I want these diagrams
to be very complimentary to exactly what
I'm trying to explain in the content.
And then for the workflow itself, it
just starts with your idea. So this
skill is assuming that you already have
a good idea of what you want to create a
diagram for. So you can iterate with
your coding agent before you load this
skill and then have it first assess the
depth of the diagram. And the reason
this is important is because we have
very simple diagrams like this. And then
we have more complicated ones like this.
Maybe this is a better example as well.
And the reason we need to assess the
depth is because for more complicated
diagrams, we have to build them section
by section. Otherwise, you'll get an
error with Claude code where it's trying
to output more than 32,000 tokens.
There's a limit there. So we have to
build it section by section cuz these
diagrams, they take quite a few tokens.
It's definitely worth it, but it does
take a while to generate these. And so
after it assesses, do I need to build it
all at once or in chunks, then it's
going to map the pattern. So taking our
idea and thinking about what shapes do
we need, what text do we need in the
diagram, putting it all together to then
build the JSON file that we can render
with the Obsidian Excalidraw plugin or
in excalidraw.com.
But after before it comes back to us, it
goes through the validation loop. This
is what I was talking about earlier,
where it renders the PNG, views the
image, finds any imperfections, and then
it'll just make direct edits to the JSON
file it already created. So, it's not
like it has to spend all the time to
create a duplicate or anything. Usually,
it'll iterate like two to four times.
Not that it's going to fix everything by
the time control passes back to us, but
it is going to be a fantastic starting
point. I also have all of my design
patterns laid out into the skill.md,
giving it examples of visual patterns,
telling it to not do boxes and boxes and
boxes. These are the kinds of things
that coding agents will do without
guidance because they generate
Excalidraw diagrams that are always way
too simple and look the same every
single time when we don't have this kind
of workflow. Multi-zoom architecture,
again, just things for variety. We have
the color system so I can be consistent
in the colors for my diagrams. And then
also the evidence artifact. So, being
really specific for the kinds of
elements that I want to really make my
diagrams educational. And these are all
the things that you can tune for
yourself, especially the color palette.
So, I'll go back to my skill here and
show you that one of the files that I
referenced in the reference folder of
the skill. This is in the GitHub repo as
well, is the color palette. And so, you
can just ask your coding agent, like,
"Hey, I want to use purples and yellows
instead of blues." or whatever, right?
And it can create the hex codes and like
put all this in the color palette. So,
that way when you are generating
diagrams going forward, it's your brand
and the color scheme that you want to
use. And so, you can edit this. You can
change the different uh element
templates that it can bring in. All of
this you can tune yourself, but also it
all works out of the box if you just
want to use it right away. So, a very
flexible skill that I have built for
you. So, there you go. That is the
Excalidraw diagram skill, and I
encourage you to clone this repo, bring
in the skill, and just try it right now
on a PDF, even a code base. You could do
research you do with an agent or just
raw text. The The
are endless, and it does such a good job
creating a starting point, literally
saving me hours and hours every single
week. And so, if you appreciated this
video, and you're looking forward to
more things on skills and agentic
engineering, I'd really appreciate a
like and a subscribe. And with that, I
will see you in the next video.
