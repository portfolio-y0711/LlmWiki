# Master Claude Design in One Video (Complete Build)

So, I'm doing something a little bit
different in this video. Instead of
showing you five one-shot Claude design
demos, I'm going to use it to rebuild
real parts of my actual business
>> [music]
>> live on screen in about 30 minutes. So,
I run the Agentic Academy on School, and
for a while now I've been looking at our
setup thinking, [music] "Our design is
okay, but it's not really us." So, I'll
be the first to admit that we don't have
a proper design system. We don't have
our own landing page. Our command
center, which is a Kanban-style UI we
built for managing our Agentic system,
>> [music]
>> doesn't have a mobile version yet. We
don't have a standard sales deck or set
of slides to produce consistent assets.
So, rather than just talk about Claude
design, I'm going to use it to fix all
of these in this video and talk about
whether to use Claude design directly or
use Claude code with specific skills for
certain things [music] instead. And I've
done a ton of research going into this.
So, Peter Yang from the Creator Economy
posted a really good walkthrough. Ryan
Mather from Anthropic posted a thread
full of tips for Claude design, and the
AI Daily Brief did a full breakdown of
where to dig deep and where to steer
clear. And Reddit's already moaning that
every single Claude design output looks
identical. So, as we build, I'll show
you how to avoid that trap and how to
actually get real business value
>> [music]
>> out of this tool. So, if you're trying
to figure out whether Claude design is
actually worth your time and what other
tools to combine it with to get the best
out of it, then this is the video. Let's
jump straight in. So, before we go ahead
and build anything, we need to
understand a few things because if
you're opening Claude design thinking
that it's going to replace Canva for you
or replace Figma because it's tanking
the Figma stock, then you're probably
going to use it wrong and get frustrated
within a few minutes. But, here's what
it actually is. Everything Claude design
makes is code under the hood. So, it
sounds quite technical, but stay with me
because it matters for how you actually
use it and the way that you interact
with it. So, Peter Yang put it really
well. Videos, slides, websites, apps,
animations, they are all effectively
just code under the hood. And because
code is cheap, Anthropic can use all
their powerful models to generate any of
them with the same AI. So, Claude code
for your back end, Claude design for
your visuals, it's the same engine, it's
just a different output on the surface.
But, what that means for you as a
business owner is pretty simple. This is
not a canvas tool, a drag and drop, move
the rectangle tool like Figma. It's much
closer to how you would use Claude
desktop or Claude code. So, you prompt
it, it builds, you iterate. You're not
going to be dragging things around, but
you are able to use some special tools
that they've implemented to target
certain things to change. And the AI
Daily Brief had a really useful framing
on this as well, which I've taken for
this video. So, they split design tools
into two camps: asset design and system
design. So, asset design is stuff like a
single post, a flyer, one image. And if
you've used Canva before, it's probably
for this asset design stuff. Then,
system design, on the other hand, is
stuff like a website, a full app, a
front end with a consistent look across
all the screens. And that is where Figma
lives. And that is closest to where
Claude design lives, too. So, Claude
design doesn't work in the same way as
Figma at all. And Ryan Mather from
Anthropic's design team said it
directly, "Stop thinking of Claude
design as a traditional canvas tool like
Figma. It's closer to Claude code than a
pixel editor." Which then means the same
principles from Claude code apply. So,
you give it good context, you let it
take some actions, and then you iterate
on those actions. So, you're basically
having a conversation, even if that
conversation is with a specific element
that you see on the page, which by the
way is the recommended way to interact
with it. And the other thing that's
really important to understand up front
is the 90/10 rule that PT Yang kept
coming back to in his demo. So, AI is
going to get you 90% of the way there,
but the last 10%, the custom micro copy,
the exact icon you need or logos, the
bit of human taste, that definitely
still needs you from what I've tried
out. So, if you go in thinking Claude
design will ship your final product, you
will be disappointed. But, if you go in
thinking it will get you from zero to
90% in a few minutes,
then you're actually going to be blown
away. Now, there's one thing that
matters more than anything else in this
tool, and if you skip this step,
everything else you produce is going to
look like AI slop. So, let's talk about
that. And, it's quite clear in the
community that a lot of people are
skipping this step because Reddit has
been going absolutely nuts for the
design results from Claude, saying
everyone thinks Claude design has one
look, and this is it. The top comments
are roasting the tool for producing the
same generic AI slop dashboard for every
single user. Get ready to see that serif
font, those colored accent bars, and the
infamous blinking green dot everywhere.
Some even think OP's original design was
better. Okay, so here is the single
biggest difference between your Claude
design output looking like AI slop or
another Anthropic website versus
actually looking like your own brand,
one that looks like you paid a lot of
money for it. And, that single biggest
difference is actually dedicating time
to the design system up front. And, one
of the main reasons that every single
design looks the same and looks like AI
slop is because in the background of
claude.ai/design,
it's quite obviously using Claude code
or Anthropic's built-in front-end design
skill. And, the irony is actually it
says generates distinctive production
grade front-end interfaces that avoid
generic AI aesthetics. But, if there's
enough of them being produced, they
become the generic AI aesthetic, and
that seems to have happened with all
these one-shot prompt landing pages that
are being built out. And, that's because
it just has a default presets it falls
back to when you give it a loose prompt.
So, when you're giving it that loose
prompt with no design specifications,
it's going to fall back to those
defaults. Even Anthropic's own prompting
documentation now mentions this. It says
Claude Opus 4.7 has a consistent default
house style with warm cream and
off-white backgrounds. So, it's
literally baked in to the way that
Claude design works. So, Ryan Mathers'
number one tip is this: spend that first
hour in Claude design, maybe two,
setting up your full design system and
your key reference screens. So, it's
going to feel painful at the start, but
it's going to pay off tenfold when you
actually see the designs at the end.
Now, just a quick warning before we
actually start building this out,
setting up your design system is
probably going to burn through more
tokens than almost anything else you do
inside Claude design. So, a couple of
quick rules to protect your quota.
Firstly, do your design system setup in
a single focus session, not spread
across multiple sessions, and only do
this if you're actually committed to
using Claude design and not just having
fun and poking around. And when we get
past the design system phase, back to
creating actual screens, you can use
regular Claude for the copy and the
structure, rather than using Claude
design, but we'll come to that. So, let
me show you how we're going to set this
up for the Agentech Academy on School.
And what we're going to tackle first is
basically a landing page. So, right now
we live inside School, which is great
for the community experience, but we
don't have a proper external landing
page where people can see more
information about what we offer. So,
something that sells the vision, shows
what's inside, and converts visitors
into members. Now, we are actually
running some ads, which link back to a
mock landing page, but you can see
they're pretty non-branded, pretty
generic, and not really represents of
our brand, not even following the color
schemes we're using on School. So,
before we go into Claude design and
actually start setting up a design
system, I just wanted to flag one
important thing, which is inside Claude
design, it's a separate app from your
Claude Claude desktop app, and it's a
separate app from Claude code when
you're hosting it in VS Code, for
example. And what that means is that it
doesn't actually come with inbuilt
custom skills. So, you might have your
own front-end design skills, or UI
design skills, but none of those are
supported at the moment inside Claude
Design. I'm sure they will be in the
future, but what that means is actually
when you're referencing and using Claude
Design, you're going to use Anthropic's
built-in front-end design skill. And
we've already talked about how that
produces generic AI aesthetics, or AI
slop. So, you need to either feed it a
design system yourself, or
feed in the right reference screenshots
to give it a design system. So, we can
kind of approach this in three ways, and
we'll actually show you two of those
ways to compare the outputs. The first
is using reference screenshots. So, it's
highly recommended that when you're
creating your design system inside the
Claude Design app, we need to make sure
that when we are actually adding things
and setting up our design system in
Claude.ai, we are uploading as much
context material to create the design
system from as possible. So, that is
method one. We're going to use reference
screens screenshots. So, we're going to
collect three to five screenshots from
websites we like, or our current brand
assets, and upload that to actually
create that design system. Or, method
two is actually using a separate skill,
and actually creating the design system
outside of the Claude Design app. So,
using what we have in the skill
ecosystem,
and in particular we'll use a skill
called Skill UI to basically extract
design principles from a given website.
So, we're able to actually extract from
a website that we like a full design
system that we can then push straight
into the Claude Design app. Or, equally
we could actually do this all in Claude
Design still, but copy and paste the
skill content from that Skill UI
directly into Claude Design. Each of
these methods has their own pros and
cons, and all of them will get you to a
Claude Design system, which we'll show.
Now, this will get you to that 90%
point. So, once we have a Claude Design
system, and we start actually creating
that landing page, hopefully with a
design system we get fewer AI
aesthetics, and something we're actually
happy with that's on brand. But, I'm
also going to show you after that 90%
how we can actually export this directly
to Claude Code, and use additional
skills to actually create that final 10%
that takes it even further away from the
AI aesthetic and closer to your brand
assets and actually something that you
look at and you're proud of and takes a
little bit longer but so worth the
effort. Because if you remember Claude
design is going to get you to the 90%
really quickly but skills on either side
of that, whether it be for creation of
the design system or actually optimizing
the result afterwards, are going to get
you to that 100% result or at least 95%.
Now for this design system input, any
thinking that we're leaving Claude to do
is going to cost us in tokens and the
token usage limits for Claude design are
separated from Claude code and separated
from the Claude chat app as well. So you
have a separate usage limit and there's
been a lot of rumors going around that
actually this is a really small limit.
So you might do one or two design
systems and then completely wipe out
your limit, whether you're a pro or a
max plan. So what we're going to do to
actually reduce the token usage is to be
more prescriptive. So the less thinking
or the less ambiguity that we can give
Claude design, one, the better design
we'll probably end up with because we
put more thought into actually planning
it out and two, we're going to save on
token usage because we're not asking it
to actually go and explore various
different design systems, we're just
feeding it in. So even where we're
feeding in reference screenshots, I'd
highly recommend following the steps
that we're going to go through and we're
actually going to go to chat GPT's new
image model, image 2.0 and effectively
create a design system or a starting
point for a design system that we're
then going to feed in as reference
screenshots. Later when we come to
actually building out the pages, we
again want to be less ambiguous and more
prescriptive with exactly what we want.
So we want a header page with a hero
section that looks like X. We want
testimonial section that looks like Y.
And we can go and pull from various
resources to make it a bit more
prescriptive, a bit less ambiguous and
therefore reduce our token usage. So if
we are going with method one of
inserting reference screenshots rather
than using the skill that extracts exact
design packages, then what we're going
to do is go to websites that we like or
like the look of and actually start
pulling those together inside ChatGPT's
new image model. And we're going to say,
"Use your new image model to help me
actually create a design system." This
way we're not using Claude Design's
thinking tokens and saving that for the
actual execution. And instead, actually
ChatGPT has really generous limits even
on the free plan for being able to
create multiple images. And the new
images that are coming out of ChatGPT
image, as you'll see, are actually
pretty incredible. So, this serves as a
really good way to actually reduce the
token usage before we feed it into
Claude Design. So, I've got a few
different references of websites that I
like the look and feel of. And all we're
doing here is extracting things like
color palettes, fonts,
uh the way things are laid out on the
page. We're effectively taking that and
trying to create our own bespoke blend
from websites we like. So, the first one
is zeno.com, which is a social API for
developers and AI agents. And you can
see this has like a nice orangey red.
And we have a similar orangey red inside
our Agently Academy. And I also like the
uh fonts that are used inside here. And
it just feels very modern. It doesn't
feel like AI slop. And it feels, yeah,
quite quite unique. So, I quite like the
look of this. So, all I'm going to do is
just take a screenshot of this. And I'll
probably take a couple of screenshots.
And I'm just going to paste them
directly inside ChatGPT. And I quite
like the design section here as well.
These little graphics. Everything feels
like it's got a place inside here. And
then the second one that I really like
the look and feel of, and I kind of like
to combine Stack AI AI and Zeno, is
stackai.com.
So, from process to AI agent in minutes.
It's all very clean, very modern. I like
the shine that comes across here. It's
got this nice video. Everything's got
these really nicely laid out borders. I
really like the rounded edges.
The
click-through of all these different
buttons here. And then if you're looking
for inspiration as well, then I'd highly
recommend going to either land-book.com
or Dribbble. And you can basically go
through all of these pages. There's some
beautiful landing pages. Say you like
the look of this one, you can click on
and it even gives you the different
color palettes. So, it could in fact
even paste in a color palette and it's
even got some parts of the design system
on there. You can go directly to the
website by hitting the visit button up
top and you can effectively take
inspiration from those as well. So, all
we're looking is to create a bespoke
design style for our own website based
on inspiration. We're not looking to
directly copy. So, use your new image
model to help me create design system on
one page, tokens, buttons,
colors, typography, use the inspiration
designs. We just tell it to use your new
image model because sometimes it decides
to default to the older image models and
the new image model is pretty
incredible. So, the first design system
came through, but what were I didn't
make very clear was that we are not
Zeno. So, we're not creating a design
system for Zeno and it's pretty much
replicated that. So, if you want to
actually emulate an existing service,
then it's basically has replicated it.
If we zoom
a bit closer on screen, you can see all
of these layouts are very similar to
what we saw actually on the Zeno site.
However, I've gone back and clarified
with ChatGPT, actually the designs I
uploaded were from several websites, not
just Zeno and they were to take
inspiration from. Don't take their logo
and I've updated our logo, added some
colors from our Agent Academy page and
then added some screens again from
stackai.com. It's then delivered a
second version. You can see this is
getting closer. We've got a bit more of
our own color palette here, a bit closer
to the oranges rather than Zeno's reds,
some really nice cards appearing in
here, lots of different colors including
the neutrals from stackai.com. However,
it's included stuff that is standard AI
slop aesthetic or AI aesthetic, things
like the enter font, the typography,
etc. So, what I'm going to do is an
additional step here is actually direct
us to this taste skill. A guy called
Leon has created a taste skill which is
basically a collection of skills that
improve how how AI tools write front end
code and we'll come back to this later
when we actually export the code from
Claude Design. But, I've actually
navigated directly into the taste skill.
So, it's a collection of skills. All
these different skills in here. I've
gone into the taste skill, and I'm
looking for the AI tails. I'm going to
copy the AI tails section, which are
basically the forbidden patterns, and
that includes things like no enter font.
We'll take that back to ChatGPT, and
I'll say, "Follow these patterns, too."
Copying that. So, you can basically pull
stuff from external resources to create
the design system before we put it into
Claude Design. And you can see how this
is going to save us a lot of tokens
because we don't have to do this
thinking using Claude Design's tokens.
We're actually going to put in something
that we're almost there with into Claude
Design, and then it's going to take it
to the next step for us and actually
create components that can be put into
different elements, like landing pages,
etc. So, all of the thinking around the
design system can be done externally
before we actually import it into Claude
Design to build the design system, so to
speak. And that will save you a ton of
time. It will stop you running over your
usage limits immediately, and it means
you're going to have something you're
really happy with before you put it into
Claude Design, as well. So, this next
version it's created is significantly
better. It's still kept everything the
same apart from it's changed a few
different things around the cards, the
typography, the buttons, etc. So, what
we're going to do now is just refine
these cards. I really like the look of
the cards that are on stackai.com. So,
I've taken a screenshot. I'm going to
describe the edits. Make sure the cards
are closely aligned with this. Borders,
shadow, rounded edges, etc. And then, I
think once we've done that, we'll
probably have a good version that we can
take into Claude Design. Now, I'm also
going to quickly show you how you do a
similar thing to emulate using Claude
Code instead of ChatGPT images, and then
we'll take our favorite one through to
Claude Design, import that into Claude
Design to actually then create our
design system. And these are looking a
lot closer to what we're expecting. So,
you can see it's now added this
uh border shadow, which looks a lot
closer to what we were expecting from
here. So, we're going to take and
download that system. One thing I'm
going to do as well, it's obviously
great to upload a design style asset
like this, but also I'm going to ask it
to put this all in a design.md.doc.
Like we want to be as thorough as
possible, so all of these standards I
basically want a design.md.doc
or just a markdown document to actually
paste into Cloud Design as as well when
we come to it. So, another method that
we're now going to show you to actually
extract an existing design system from a
website is using this skill UI package.
So, this is a command line interface
tool that reverse engineers any design
system into a Cloud ready skill. So, to
install it we're just going to copy this
command line here, and we also want to
use ultra mode because basically that
can go and visually extract the elements
including the hover interfaces etc. from
a website so that we can emulate it. You
can see what you get in here. You get
all the color tokens, the typography,
the spacing, the hover and focus focus
interactions. You get scroll journey
screenshots, and it's all saved in its
own uh folder. So, if you're emulating
Notion for example, you get a Notion
design folder with a skill, and then you
can jump inside there inside Cloud Code
itself and say actually inside this
folder read the Cloud.md, build me a UI
that matches this. So, arguably with
this skill, you don't even need Cloud
Design, but there are a few elements
where Cloud Design really helps you
refine your ideas that
is the exact reason we're still going to
actually go and use this and port this
into Cloud Design. So, let's go to a new
terminal in VS Code. We're going to
install
this. So, we're going to run npm install
-g skill UI. We're also going to go and
make sure we've installed Playwright and
Chromium, which are basically going to
be able to go and scan those websites
for us. So, we're going to run those
commands as well. And this is the way it
works. You extract a design design
system from a URL. You open the output
folder and run Cloud Code, and then you
just ask Cloud to build your UI. But,
what we're effectively just doing is the
extraction of the system step, so we can
then pass that into Cloud Design as
well. But, we want to do it in the full
cinematic, ultra mode,
which uses Playwright to capture scroll
screenshots, interactions, animations,
etc. So, we want to see how well this
can pull from a given design brief. You
want to copy this command, skill-ui
{dash} {dash} url. And for this one,
we're going to actually
use stackai.com because I really like
the cleanliness of this, and we can
always add colors at a later date. So,
to clarify, we've already got a design
system that we've built inside ChatGPT.
That's one method. The second method is
just emulating a design system and
pulling that inside Crawl Code. So,
we've got skill-ui stackai mode ultra.
We need to make sure URL is in there.
Put the URL afterwards.
And we're going to run that. It's got
this really nice interface, website
crawling, and it's basically using zero
API keys. So, it's pure static analysis.
It's not going to cost us a thing to
scan these websites and actually build
out a website design system for
stackai.com that we can then actually
take into either ChatGPT to create
design system from that or just put it
directly with all the text inside Crawl
Design as well. So, that extracted in
probably a couple of minutes, and you
know, it's extracted the colors, the
fonts, the components, all animations,
and it's output a completely new file
called stackai design. That file has a
skill.md. If we were to come in here
inside this folder and ask it to build
out a UI, it would directly understand
to work from this skill.md. It's got all
of our design elements combined in one
long design.md. So, you can see color
palette and roles, CSS variable tokens,
typography rules. And then we've even
got all of these individual things
broken out into individual folders. So,
we've got the colors.json, spacing.json.
We've got screenshots. So, we've got the
homepage screenshot. We've got literally
screenshots of every single scroll
element on the page. We've got
references for our components, our
animations. We've got all of the
different fonts. And you can see, for
example, that we've got longer
screenshots for the full pricing page.
And all of these elements we can
basically work off of. So, if we were
building a design directly in this
folder, which we'll do for a comparison
point, it's basically going to read from
this design and start building it out
exactly using these patterns, which is
super cool. For the purpose of what we
are trying to demonstrate inside Claude
Design, we take the design.md and
probably a few of the screenshots and
then put that into Claude Design so that
we can actually edit it and work with it
in Claude Design. But, I'm also going to
actually do a comparison directly of
building in Claude Design versus just
doing the website inside this folder.
So, I'm going to CD into the folder
stackai design, open up Claude, and I'm
just going to say, "Build me a landing
page based on the stackai design." Just
give it a really broad brief. It's going
to start reading from this specific
scale. It knows all of the fonts, the
references, the screens, etc. And let's
see how close it can get to actually
emulating the design we had there. But,
I'm also going to copy and paste that
design system, the design.md, and take a
few of the screens, and we're going to
go back now to Claude Design and start
building it out inside Claude Design.
Now, just to remind you, we've got two
different design systems here, and we're
going to try them both out. So, we've
got design system one, which is the
one-pager that we got from ChatGPT
images directly. Another way is to
actually just emulate an existing design
system, which is why we use the scale
inside Claude code. So, just two
different methods of approaching the
same problem. Now, we want to actually
turn this into a design system with
actual tokens we're happy with inside
Claude Design, and we're going to do it
for both of these methods and then
compare. So, we're going to go into the
design systems at claude.ai/design,
and we're going to create a new design
system. We're going to do it for the
Agentic Academy, and then the blurb is
going to be, "Build Agentic systems that
run your business." We're not going to
link the code on GitHub because we don't
have any. But, for the first system, we
will actually go and link the code from
the computer, and we will link it
directly to the stackai design. So,
we're going to have the full folder of
assets available from that folder there.
And we can even add the fonts, logos,
and assets. Let's go in and add our logo
first of all. Then, if we go into the
Stack AI design, we can add the fonts
folder and we'll also add the tokens
like the typography, spacing, colors
because then Claude doesn't have to
think about what it's doing. It's just
basically taking the design system
already. And then we're going to go and
copy again the design.md and I'm just
going to paste that design.md directly
inside here. So we've given it access to
the assets, we've given it access to the
full design file with screens and now we
can continue to generation. It will take
about 5 minutes to generate a design
system. Let's keep it open in the back
background and whilst we do that, we're
going to do the same again.
But this time we're going to pass in
just the inspiration that we took from
ChatGPT. So we're going to download that
image. I'm going to make sure we upload
that inside the fonts, logos and assets.
And we're also going to take the design
system one page markdown document that
we got it to create from the back off
the back of that and we're going to
paste that directly in there. So this
one has fewer assets to actually build
from, but let's continue to the
generation. Let's generate that and
let's see how our two design systems
come out. And you can see the first
design system has started working. It's
got a bunch of to-dos. It's really nice
interface because actually it updates us
with a bunch of like, this is what I'm
going to do. So I'm going to explore the
Stack AI code base and uploads. I'm
going to read the design tokens. I'm
going to set the project title. I'm
going to copy the logo and visual
assets. And you can see that it's
updating us as it goes through with
exactly what it's reading, what it's
doing and this is why it takes so many
tokens to do because actually we've
uploaded a lot of different information
here and I'm really keen to see how this
comes out. Now the next step will play
out that actually Claude will come back
and ask us a series of questions and
this is why you don't actually
independently do this inside Claude
code. If you want more of an iterative
flow, then you use something like Claude
design because actually it's going to
ask you a bunch of questions, you get to
feedback on certain things. We're then
going to show you how to actually
interact with certain elements on the
page to make some smaller changes. All
of these things are much harder when
you're actually generating a page
directly inside VS Code or Claude Code
for example. So let's come back to
Claude design and review the two
separate outputs. So, the first one is
the one that was based on our Chat GPT
design system where we had all of these
colors, the Satoshi variable font. You
can see that it's got really clean
interface when you start to interact
inside Cloud Design. It lays everything
out really nicely. So, you can actually
give it direct feedback. So, the colors
look good, for example. So, we can say
these look good, and then it switches to
the next card. These neutrals look good
as well. And then, I guess the semantic
colors look good. Backgrounds look
pretty good. And then, uh the primary
family of fonts is Satoshi variable,
which I think was correct. So, we can
say that these look good, and then we
even can see the different header
levels. So, we've got header one, header
two, etc. And if we wanted to say, you
know, actually make the top header
larger, then we could do that by hitting
the needs work button. But, all of these
look pretty good. I like the typography
there. The spacing grid looks good. And
it looks like it's effectively taken a
lot of that inspiration from the design
that we fed in in the first place. And
what we're effectively doing is heading
down all of these different cards to
approve various different things. And
you can see this is what the buttons are
going to look like. So, when you hover
over them, they're going to look like
this. When they're disabled, they're
going to look like this. I think these
look quite good. Secondary and ghost
buttons, these look good also. So, we
basically go through all of these
different forms and approve them so we
get an individual look at exactly what
we're approving. So, let's say actually
we don't want the focus to uh blend
orange. We can actually describe what we
prefer.
So, more subtle orange on the focus box.
We submit that. That's going to be put
into the inputs in the chat on the
left-hand side, and it will effectively
go and change that and then put it back
for us for review again. These look
good. It's now actually made that
immediately more subtle. So, by editing
this specific element rather than
actually just asking about the whole
site and inserting all of the context
again, what we're able to do is actually
reduce the token usage. So, you use a
lot of tokens up front, but you can
actually save a lot of tokens by doing
what we've done and actually designing
the design system like elsewhere and
then bringing it into Cloud Code at a
later point so that you are more
comfortable just approving things. If
we'd just written a prompt to start
with, there would have been a lot more
back and forth where we'd use more
tokens to do this. And equally, instead
of going through the needs review, you
can actually go down to any of these,
right? So, you can see all of the ones
we've ticked so far and these are all
the ones that we need reviewing. So, you
can see the alerts.
And you can say looks good there. So,
what we're doing is just giving Cloud
direct feedback on what we think about
the designs here. And when you tick
looks good, it's not passing it's not
costing us any tokens. It's only when we
say needs work. So, we're going to say
looks good to all of these. I mean, it's
done a really good job to be honest.
Agentech Academy, it's taken the logo
in. We've got a dark and a light
version. And now we start to get into
the actual marketing kit, which is
effectively our feedback on specific
designs. So, before we go and actually
create any pages, it just gives us like
a hero and how that hero would look. So,
it's build agentic systems that run your
business. I don't really like the
Agentech Academy V2 button up there.
Orchestrate AI agents with
enterprise-grade security from process
to AI agent in minutes. Designed for IT
and enterprise architecture teams. So,
it doesn't have any context of the
audience that I'm serving. So, all of
that copy is totally wrong. But, we're
not really worried about the copy right
now. We're just worried about the AI
aesthetic. And then we can scroll down
the hero and you can see it's reverted a
little bit here back to this AI icons
and the Bento grids
that are commonly seen in AI interfaces
as well. Let's say looks good for now.
We then have an app console kit so we
can see what this might look like on the
back end. And this is quite nice
actually. So, we've gone through, we've
approved everything and it says now your
design system is ready. And what we're
able to do is click publish and then we
can actually use this system to create a
new design for our landing page. So,
we've got nothing yet in terms of a
landing page. So, I also wanted to show
you that in the back end, you can see
all of the different design files that
are feeding any design going forwards
with this design skill. So, it's set up
in a similar way so that UI skill
actually generates designs. So, we've
even got a skill.md that's been
generated on our behalf for this design
system. So, if we open the skill.md, it
says use this skill to generate
well-branded interface and assets for
Aglet Academy. So, anytime we ask it to
generate something for the Aglet
Academy, it's able to actually take this
skill. So, if we wanted to, if we didn't
need the interface here, we could
effectively take all of these project
files, download them, put them into our
Cloud Code, and then actually use this
this design system and start building
out from there. So, if you wanted to
save your credits, you could actually do
that. But, I really like the visual
interface that we're given to actually
go through all of the different HTML
elements. You can literally see they're
all previewing on the right-hand side,
and you can open those up in larger
detail, too. But, not only that, you can
actually ask it to make a tweak. You can
add a comment that your team can see.
You can make edits directly, like adding
a background, changing the fonts. And
actually, you can just highlight things
like this, and use voice mode, or
actually just click. And what we could
say is leave a specific comment on a
specific element. And this is why it's
more powerful than using something like
Cloud Code out of the box, because you
are not in Cloud Code able to at this
granular level make an iteration. So, we
could, for example, say, "Make the
outside of this button glow
when it's hovered on." And you can see
preview failed to render. So, it was
actually working then, but for some
reason had a bit of a glitch, and this
is part of the problem so far in Cloud
Design that a lot of people experience.
So, we're just going to try it again.
Give it more of a glow
when being hovered.
So, again, uh failing to
failing to render. So, you can see that
these edits are trying to be pushed in
the left-hand side, but nothing is
happening. So, maybe we need to do this
on a
per design basis, rather than going into
individual files. So, it's a bit glitchy
at the moment with edits, but the
interface is really nice. You can see
also all of the uploads that we added.
Now, let's quickly view the second
design system, which to remind you was
made by emulating stackai.com's.
So, this is not correct because it
should be
the Agentech Academy on stackai. And
we're going to go through and just
make sure we're happy with the design
system used inside here. And I really
like the fonts that's being used in
here, and this has been taken directly
from the stackai page that we were happy
with. This all looks good.
Like these handwritten marks. I don't
like that it's on a gray background.
Remove the gray backgrounds behind the
logo. This should be a white background.
And also, academy should have the same
font as the Agentech in the word mark.
And all of those get pushed in the
left-hand side and back into our review
queue, which is great. Then we got our
spacing, the different types of
elevation,
components. And then we've got a
separate hero section here. Oh, I don't
like the blue so much now that I'm
seeing it like this, but I do prefer
this style over the other one that we
saw. We go back to the hero section of
the other one where we created it using
the chat GPT images, it looks a bit more
AI-generated,
bit more like AI slop, whereas this
looks a bit neater in the design,
especially with these different cards,
actually. So, right now I'm siding with
emulating existing website and porting
in that design system and then taking
that. I actually don't like the blue in
the header. Can we change those to be
like a gray color for like solutions,
templates, customers, pricing,
resources? So, change that in the actual
component, and hopefully it can actually
understand which component to change,
and then it goes through and will make
the changes there. So, it hasn't
actually understood which component to
change
the blue inside, but let's see if we can
go to the specific component and
actually make that change. Can we change
the blues here to more subtle gray
colors? So, let's see if we change it in
the component whether it will actually
change back in the marketing UI kit as
well. And what's great is you get the
visibility on the left-hand side of
exactly what is being changed, so you
can see now login and learn more is a
more subtle color. Make sure the header
has the same colors as displayed in the
component, so it shouldn't have blue
text for the drop-downs, it should have
gray text. Okay, so we're happy with
that design. We can also see the design
files again and actually share those if
we wanted to hand it off to Claude Code.
It's also useful at this point to go
into claude.ai/settings/usage
and you can see where you are at with
your current Claude design usage. So,
I'm on the 20x max plan. So, if you're
on the pro plan, you might have already
hit your limit by this point, but we've
basically got its own weekly limit and
I've used 25% by just doing the two
design briefs where we barely had to do
any thinking. All of the work was done
outside of Claude design. So, you can
see how quickly you eat up your usage
here. But, keep an eye on that as we
start to build out more. Now, based on
the two design systems that we've taken
through, we've got to now decide which
one we want to build out our landing
page using. And I think actually the
clean look of this system
is a lot more fitting to my brand than
this, which looked a bit more generic.
Although it has nicer colors, I like the
oranges that fit with the brand. I think
this one looked, although it's
monochromatic, nicer in terms of the
cards
and the general layout and the fonts.
So, I'm actually going to go forward
with this Stack AI design system. And
what I can do now is actually use the
system to create a new design. So, I
know it seems like we've done a lot of
work up until this point, but we've
shown you a few different methods in
which you can actually create your
design system. And from all of the
threads and tips that I've read, this is
the most important thing, creating the
design system up front, one that you
like, being able to stray away from
those AI aesthetics. So, make sure that
you spend your time actually planning
out that process and building a design
system you like that you can then give
good references to Claude design and not
actually sponge all of your Claude
design usage immediately trying to go
back and forth with Claude design to
change a few colors in the design for
example. Now, the benefit in doing all
of this up until this point is that
design system does not only go across
our landing page. We can now use that
for our slide deck, our app development,
and for everything that Claude is
basically going to add into this visual
asset list, we can now use this design
system and we've got consistent design
system. Now, if you remember, we set
Claude code off in the background with a
task to actually just build out a UI
straight up straight off the bat to
emulate stackai.com. So, let's go back
and revisit how it actually performed.
So, whilst we were messing around with
all this typography and giving specific
feedback, how did it do straight out the
box with that scale UI scale in
rebuilding it based on everything it had
taken from the website. So, we had the
original stackai website just to remind
you. We've got these hover effects.
We've got the video up here. We've got
trusted by these different clients. Then
we've got sections with all of these
really nice nicely laid out cards. So,
on the left-hand side is the one that
it's built on our behalf. It's even got
this a few stacked things as a logo that
it's built here. You can see it's not
exactly the same font, but it is very
similar. It's even taken the video asset
from stackai.com. It's copied all of the
headers up here and has a similar set of
highlights. All the highlight colors
look very very similar. The hover effect
hasn't quite copied over. So, these are
all got hover effects over here, but you
actually can't really see the hover
effects here. The cards definitely
aren't as nice down here, right? But
it's tried to emulate this. What we do
best, stack AI features, and it's
created a bunch of cards. This is very
AI aesthetic, so we need to go in and
change that. But you can see that
actually it's tried to bring all of the
same text across and we could have an
image in here. And I must say I'm quite
impressed with what it's done out of the
box. Now, if we did not use the scale UI
scale to extract this from stackai.com,
then we probably would have ended up
with something that was pretty pretty
generic and using the Inter font and all
of those AI telltale signs. But this
actually, straight out the box, doesn't
look that AI generated and I'm quite
impressed with that. The difference,
however, comes to when you want to make
those iterative changes to specific
things, specific elements on the page.
So, it might be quite clear if you want
to make a change to the title. That's
not going to be very difficult. But you
can't pinpoint a specific logo on this
page visually like you can in Claude
design and say, "Actually, just change
this icon." It's basically got to push a
load of context back into it and it will
take a lot longer to identify the exact
resource unless you go through the code
base and try and find that yourself. So,
what Claude design enables is for you to
go into those specific design files and
give the feedback on that specific
element and therefore it'll be changed
across all your designs. So, maybe
that's in the design system or as we'll
see when we create a landing page from
the design file, you can do that on a
component level on a page and that is
what makes this really powerful. So,
let's start off with our landing page.
And we're going to go create. We're
going to start with the context of the
design system and we're going to choose
our chosen design system. We can also
actually start with a sketch. So, if we
have a good idea of what things should
look like in terms of the landing page,
then we're actually going to start with
a sketch. And what we are going to do is
actually go to our ad page and just
redesign this ad page based on our new
design system. We'll take the same text.
We'll take the same video embedded at
the top. And what we're trying to do is
effectively create all of this in a
nicer format with the testimonials, with
the FAQs, just a simple landing page to
demonstrate exactly how you build this
out. So, we can take screenshots now.
And I'm just going to individually
screenshot these so we give it the best
possible chance to emulate these
resources. And you can see I'm being
really detailed adding every single
screenshot. So that has a lot of files
to work from. But what we don't want to
do what we want to avoid the trap of is
getting it to just recreate this fairly
generic structure that we've got in our
website already. So we're going to make
that clear in the prompt and this is
where you get a few more issues with
Claude. So we've attached loads of files
and now we have to zoom out massively to
get to the describe what you want to
create button at the bottom. So we're
going to say using this design system
I've attached a page that we've got that
is currently a landing page for our
Agenteur Academy. It has a hero at the
top which is embedding a YouTube video
and I can link to the YouTube video.
It's got a link to the school.com/grapes
which is the Agenteur Academy. I've
attached details of all the different
sections through screenshots on the
page. Includes features, includes
testimonials and includes FAQs. I've
also attached some of the images as part
of those feature sections. I want you to
create a structure based on the design
system not based on the screenshots but
include all of those elements, please.
And again, we have to zoom out a little
bit but let's
let's check we're happy with that. And
now hopefully we've given it enough
context to actually plan this out in
detail. If you don't know how you want
your landing page to look, I'd highly
recommend going to landbook.com, finding
a website that looks like you might like
the sections of. So if you're on an
e-commerce business, go and find an
e-commerce website or you can go to
sections inside here and you can see
like actually I want my you know value
proposition to look like this. I want my
feature section to look like this. And
this one's quite nice actually. And what
you can do is screenshot it and then
take it back to Claude design and say
actually I want the feature section to
look more like this. So we're actually
going to be able to iterate on it in a
moment but if you don't have a design
already then I'd recommend actually
thinking about you know what sections do
you want on the website? What sections
make sense and just emulate what good
looks like right now in the market. And
you can see, okay, it's listing the
files, it's reading the files. I have
enough context to build this now. Let me
set up the project files and build the
page following the design system. So,
it's now starting out on actually
building out the landing page for us.
And we'll come back and show you how it
looks and how we can iterate on it. And
I'm just going to go check my usage and
we're currently at 30%. So, it's only
used 5% more doing that, but don't
forget I'm on the max plan. So, on the
right-hand side we've got our previous
landing page, on the left-hand side
we've got our new design. The text is so
much nicer. Like, I must say the text is
so much nicer. These sections also in
the features are laid out in a nicer
way. So, we have the one on the left,
one on the right, one on the left uh
switching there. And we also have you
know, these subtitles for that. It's
also actually taken the screenshots that
I put in of the Agenty OS, which were in
our old branding colors and actually
updated those as if it was going to be
in these new colors. So, we need to
change them back to what the Agenty OS
uh command center actually looks like.
But, you know, this is not looking bad.
It's also made a bit of a mess of some
of these screenshots rather than taking
them as is. However, the structure of
the general page is fairly nice. It's
then taken the what members are saying
and again these were screenshots from
before and I think the screenshots
probably look a bit better, but these
are definitely clearer to read. A live
feed of Windows builds and milestones.
Yeah, like actually quite like this.
It's also taken all of the text and has
it taken it verbatim? Let's have a look.
What makes Agenty OS different from
Claude code on its own? Claude code
alone has no memory. So, yeah, it
literally has has taken the exact text
as well from the screenshots, which is
quite impressive. Then down here we've
got our logo, which it's turned into
this uh spinning GIF almost. And it's
saying, you know, you can get the Agenty
OS or watch the intro lesson and then
get the Agenty OS actually links
directly, I can see down there, to our
landing page. So, join 1,200 members
using Agenty OS to run their projects,
clients, and businesses on autopilot.
And then it's got a bunch of links down
here, none of which actually link to
anything right now. Agentic Academy, the
operating system for Cloud Code, build,
deploy, and run agents around your
business. I mean, I must say, I overall
I'm very impressed, and I don't think it
looks very AI generated, which was
exactly the reason we'd gone
down this approach to generate stuff in
this style. However, there are a few
bugs that we can actually draw directly
on here and comment directly on here to
change. So, actually, if we click
comment, we get this really nice
interface that's almost like any other
web builder, where it says, you know,
describe the issue or suggestion, and
it's quite clear that this isn't very
nice because it's huge. So, we can say
reduce the size of the
main header. And we can send that to
Claude. We can see on the left-hand side
we are able to actually select
individual elements, and it will only
take that little bit of context cuz it
knows exactly what element it is, and it
will edit the style.css file directly,
which is the file that's going to
determine the font size for these main
headers, and it will reduce it. So,
that's not going to take much context at
all, and we can literally go back to our
usage. We can see, I think that had
actively updated. We've used 2% to make
that change. So,
it's significant, but if we were
actually going back to Cloud Code and
asking it to check make that change and
weren't able to pinpoint the element, it
would use significantly more. We can
also go in and edit it directly, so we
don't need to use AI tokens. We can
actually, you know, go in and edit the
text, so it's exactly like if we're
using something like WordPress, Webflow,
or Framer. Let's delete the lesson here.
How to use Cloud Code as an Agentic
Operating System.
And maybe we actually put a space in
there, and that looks a bit better. So,
actually now we're starting to get a
real feel of what things can start to
look like. We'll say 1,200 members
letting AI agents handle their work.
Let's try to draw function, and this
isn't something I necessarily want for
myself, but maybe it's like watch the
video and points down to the video down
here, just to see if it's able to
actually do that. Ah, that's cool. So,
we can click and then start typing. Make
this watch the video, make it not a
button, and make it just like an arrow
pointing down at the video below it. And
then we can send or queue that message.
Let's see if it works this time on the
landing page. And you can see it's
actually sent the drawing
with that saying, you know, here's the
note, here's the drawing, make that
change. So, again, it's like targeting a
specific element and trying to make that
change. So, let's see. So, it's
reloaded. It's got watch the video and
then get the Agenty OS.
Not sure exactly it's understood that.
So, let's try it with a comment. So,
again, you know, AI is open to
interpretation. If I wasn't very clear
with my instructions, then on me be it.
Actually, I'm going to try it again with
the drawing. Then going to add my
comment. Instead of saying watch the
video as a button, I don't want it to be
a button. I want it to just basically be
a secondary call to action. The first is
get the Agenty OS, so that should be the
main button. And then the secondary call
to action is like a subtext, watch the
video with an arrow like I've drawn
pointing down to the video below. So,
like a graphical arrow. And this time
I'm just going to copy that text. And I
tried to add it in down here, but it
does not work. So, let's just make sure
we have the arrow on there. We might
need to come across to the left-hand
side and actually just, you know, find
an arrow somewhere else and like a
graphical representation of an arrow to
try and get this through. But, I'm just
trying to see how easy it is to actually
make these edits and how much context
it's actually going to take up every
time. So, you say the benefit is like
actually being able to edit these
things, but if it isn't able to edit
these things at the moment, then you
might as well just be doing this in code
code and just, you know, asking the same
things if it's not going to rinse your
context. And again, it's not understood.
It has moved the get the Agenty OS to
over here, but it's still got watch the
video and no arrow down there. So, what
I'm going to go to is ChatGPT. This is a
better idea and give it the same
information. Upload the screenshot. I
want you to create a diagram that's a
graphical representation of this landing
page, but instead of the watch the video
call to action, it should just be like a
playful watch the video with a graphical
arrow pointing down at the video below
it. Draw that in the similar style to
the UI that you see. Let's see if we
send that prompt if ChatGPT can get
close to that representation. And once
we've got that image, then we can bring
it back to the chat window across here
and try and do the same again. So, it'll
be the third time trying to do the same
thing. We've seen that we can actually
make comments on specific things, but we
can't actually append like images. What
would be really helpful is we if we can
make a comment directly on this, append
the image that we're going to get from
ChatGPT, and therefore make the change.
Like, in contrast to something like
Figma or Canva, where you'd be able to
actually, you know, make the changes
directly, we can only make the changes
up to an extent. We can obviously make
edits on here around background, font,
the size of things, but these are all
deterministic things. We can't just drag
this across the page. We have to
actually, if we want to move it, like we
have to decide, you know, how much
margin it has, how much padding it has,
but this is all going to be a little bit
complicated in this app. And the idea
isn't to build the perfect website here,
it's to mock up a 90% version so we can
prove it elsewhere. So, it's mocked it
up there, like watch the video. And I
actually quite like that. I'm going to
download it, and then we're going to go
back across here, go upload that file
directly. So, change the watch the video
to not be a link, but just the text on
the page, like the screenshot attached.
And with all this back and forth, you
can see we're still on 32% use. So,
these aren't using a huge amount of
tokens, and that is the best way, and
the way that others advise to to
actually interact with this website or
interact with your designs is just like
pick an element on the page, and
actually focus on that element. Now,
what we can see is happening is what we
probably expected to happen, which is we
have this really great, you know, human
idea for a design, which can be
represented in an image, but when we try
to actually execute it using something
like Cloud Design, it's very
deterministic. It needs to put something
on a page in a given place. So, it would
need, for example, to put this image
next to the Aventador S, and the image
is what is actually being rendered in
the background, or the background is
rendered with this watch the video image
there. So, it can't quite compute how it
actually is able to do that, and
therefore it struggled to do it. So,
what we're left doing is actually just
commenting or drawing on here, remove
the watch the video and blue arrow
entirely from here, and just center the
get the Aventador S button. Also,
everywhere on the page where it says
plan start at $77 a month, say plan
start at $37 a month. Let's see if it's
able to, even though we selected that
element, actually change elements like
the plan start at text at multiple areas
on the on the page. So, really putting
it through its paces here. But, yeah,
all the guides that I've read have
talked about being really specific and
really prescriptive with the changes you
want to make, and that's how we got to
this nice-looking landing page in the
first place, because we were really
prescriptive with the design system
going into it. And, as we expected, it's
only done one thing at a time, so we
have to go in and say,
get rid of this, and yeah, maybe it's
best to actually pick individual things
and only focus on one change at a time.
Plan start at $37 a month, and you can
see
that we can, you know, queue a bunch of
changes and see how when it reloads,
hopefully all of those changes we made.
So, make a single change at once, and
then reload it after all the changes.
But, yeah, be really prescriptive with
that single change, and that's the
lesson you learned there. Now, the
problem with, you know, it redesigning
these images is it's actually built out
these images, and they are not images,
they're kind of elements. It's actually
mocked up. So, we can see, for example,
how this might struggle when we actually
start to compress the page. You can see
that we've got things like the buttons
starting to squash there and the page is
not responsive. So we're just going to
use a blanket statement which is
make the page
mobile responsive. Also in the features
list
e.g. one dashboard for everything, make
sure that the images that are showing
the dashboard are just the actual
images. So I'm going to upload the
actual now in order. I think we had four
images which I'll attach here and then
we can reload, let it try and tackle the
responsiveness and let it try and tackle
the images and insert the images instead
of trying to mock up these dashboards.
It's kind of done too much work um for
us because we weren't prescriptive
enough in our landing page design. Okay,
so we've reloaded. It's changed these to
$37 a month and you can see it's it's
really messed up on this image addition
there. Let's see if it's responsive.
It is looking pretty responsive. There's
a few bugs here and there but we're not
worried about uh fixing those too much
for this demonstration but this image
issue is a problem. So let's go down
here. The images that you just added,
that I uploaded, they're huge so they no
longer fit next to the features. Can you
scale them to be this a similar size to
the actual features like schedule once,
run 24/7. And once that is ready, I
think I'm pretty happy with this. It
looks like an authentic landing page
that is branded in a way that I like and
I think fits our branding. The text
obviously on yours might be a bit
different if you didn't have a landing
page that you were already working off
and you were working on one that you
needed to spin up and I would not
recommend using Claude design to
optimize the text. I would use a
copywriting skill or a conversion rate
optimization skill. We've got more info
in the community around, you know, the
different skills that you can use for
that. However, for the design, this is
really a cool way to interact with it
and build out, you know, you've got the
different design files, you've got the
landing page HTML which you can interact
with directly, draw on, make comments,
even if it doesn't work perfectly. Now,
the difference, if you think about it,
between how we've built this up with
claw.ai/design,
their design tool, versus what we did
earlier where we just used the uh
skill UI to basically mock up the same
landing page. Like, this looks pretty
good, but we need to make a hell of a
lot of changes to actually apply all of
our brand contacts, convert it to
everything that we see on screen.
Whereas, this has taken these same
elements, but actually
able to apply it to our contacts and our
brand. So, there are benefits in
obviously emulating this directly from
claw code and doing that. There are
benefits of doing it inside the design
system which we've seen today. You can
see it still hasn't managed this image
problem, so I'll keep fixing that. And
then, once we've managed the image
problem, we can then export it to claw
code and what we're going to do is take
the taste skill. I'll leave the links
down below in the description. We're
going to install by just running this
command in the terminal, and MPX skills
add the taste skill, and then we're just
going to go into VS code, give it the
contents of the file that we download
from claw design, and just tell it,
"Okay, we're going to use the redesign
skill. Use this when a project already
exists and needs to be improved. It
focuses on auditing the current UI
first, fixing the weak layout, spacing,
hierarchy, and styling decisions." So,
it's designed to take what we've got and
add that 10% that we talked about at the
end of it. So, basically, building the
app, which we've done, and then taste
skill in claw code is that final 10%
polish. And we'll see how that compares
to the claw design that they actually
created here, and show you whether it's
actually worth doing or not. So, we can
see it's sorted out the images now, and
I'm pretty happy with how this is all
looking now.
I might even go back and increase the
font size here. And then what we can do
is hit share. I'm interested to do it as
a handoff to Claude code. So, we can
send it to our local coding agent, or we
can send it to Claude code web, or we
can download the zip. So, it's going to
say fetch this design file, read its
read me, and implement the relevant
aspects of the design. Let's copy the
command. Let's open up a new Claude code
terminal here. And then we're going to
use the taste skill to redesign that
specific HTML file or that design. So,
when we use this taste skill, because
they're effectively just a set of
skills, we can point it at any file. So,
we're just going to say use the redesign
skill on this landingpage.html file. So,
once that's built, we'll just type that
into Claude and let the taste skill go
to work, and we'll show you the
difference between the version that
we've mocked up in Claude design versus
the version where it's actually the AI'd
and done the extra 10%, and we'll see
what it identified as like AI traits in
which are the things that it's actually
gone and changed. And okay, we've come
across an error. So, it says, "Could you
download the HTML file or paste the HTML
content into that?" So, we're going to
go back to share, and let's just export
as a standalone HTML.
Right now, we don't need necessarily the
design files to come with it. If we did,
we'd download the whole project as a
zip. And this will make it quicker
because we'll just take it directly into
this instance, and actually just use the
redesign skill directly on that. So,
make sure you install the redesign
skill, and I've got mine in here in my
Agentic OS, there's redesign skill. So,
we're going to just open up Claude code,
and we're going to say redesign based on
the best practice in the
there's redesign skill. I'm just going
to add a new file in here,
landingpageoriginal.html.
I'm going to take that opened.html file,
and there are probably easier ways to do
this, but I'm going to put it inside
this landingpageoriginal.html
file, save that, and then just right
click, copy the relative path, give it
that, and let it spin off and start
working on that landing page redesign.
And then I'm really keen to see side by
side like what things it identifies as
AI aesthetics and then how that looks
compared to the version that we've
actually spun up at the end.
>> So, bringing it back here
[clears throat] now, it's run through
the redesign. Here's what the redesign
addressed from the audit. So, it's added
some
formatting around the typography,
including weight variety, to give it
some like inconsistency, I guess natural
inconsistency. It's changed some stuff
around the colors, the layout, removed
the zigzag reverse pattern. Features now
alternate media position, interactivity.
So, when you actually active or press on
all buttons, there's some difference in
how it scales. It's changed the content
from generic numbers like 1,200 to 1247.
So, it's a non-round number. It's added
some stuff around accessibility and code
quality and then some components have
been changed. So, for example, the
testimonial avatars they're using uh
squirkles or rounded squares instead of
circles and the FAQ replaced the
traditional accordion. So, we can now go
into the HTML file that it's spit out of
this and yours might spit out a HTML
file as well. And above that, it also
has a bunch of stuff it's identified in
the audit, by the way. So, we can uh go
back and we can open up just a HTML
previewer and on the right-hand side,
you can see the reformatted version,
which is supposedly a little less AI
generated. So, you can see it's changed
the numbers up here. It's made
everything a bit more rounded.
Ooh, I don't like this. So, it's changed
the bullets to uh emojis there. Instead
of uh having these uh alternate features
on here, it's got kind of individual
features, although it's replaced the
images with stock images and then it has
also changed down here these
testimonials to put them in more or
less. Now, it is very responsive, like
this is better for the screen size that
I'm operating on and then if I open it
up, let's see if it actually Yeah, it
does It does do better for the uh screen
size elements. However, most of it I
would say I actually prefer the Claude
design out the box. Whether it looks
more AI or not, I think the actual
design of this is much cleaner than what
we've been given over here at the edge.
It's also changed the logo for some
reason. So, it's quite clear that this
taste design does not handle some things
very well, but it does do it to a
specific aesthetic. Now, one thing that
we should try also is to actually run
the same prompt again. If we press up,
redesign based on the best practices,
but instead now we will say, for
example, there's more skills inside
there. One of them is the brutalist
skill. So, it's going to apply Well, we
can either do minimalist or we can do
brutalist. Maybe we'll do both and see
the difference. But, let's actually use
this skill because it's a useful skill
to see different output. So, I'm
actually saying not redesign, reformat
using Let's do the brutalist skill. And
let's point original landing page rather
than the one it has just edited. So,
reformat using the brutalist skill. I'm
also going to open up a second terminal
and do exactly the same to do the
minimalist skill. So, it's going to
redesign both of those. Let's have a
quick look at the brutalist skill, quick
look at the minimalist skill. And I'm
just showing you this because actually
maybe Claude design isn't the be-all and
end-all and you can actually leverage
skills inside Claude code to do this
instead or to do the work that Claude
design would be able to do. And if we
just quickly flash up the two that we've
redesigned with the taste skill. The
first one is the minimalist. So, you can
see that it's kind of changed all the
aesthetic on the fonts. And then as we
go down, it's kind of just made things a
little bit more simple and animations
have been added to sort of load in
things as you scroll through the page.
But, not a huge amount has changed, but
actually it's quite nice and minimalist.
And then the other style that's built in
that we've tested out is the brutalist.
And you can see that this is totally
totally different. And of course, you
can go in and change the color schemes
here, but this is completely different
style, but I actually quite like it.
It's very agentic operating system vibe,
where you've got everything in this dark
chromatic view with like some accent
red. We've got like this code script
type text. You've got the
nice hover animations across to play the
YouTube video. All of these sections
which have been been put into grids. Of
course, it's taken the incorrect images
again, but we could always replace those
quite easily. But this is quite a nice
way to lay this all out, and this is
very, very different style and does not
look AI generated at least from from my
point of view at all. So, let's say the
landing page is now complete. Okay, so
the next project now we finished the
landing page is wireframing. So, another
thing that Claude Design is supposedly
really good at is creating prototypes or
wireframes of different processes, and
we didn't really get the interactivity
of Claude asking us different questions
because we were so prescriptive in the
last uh brief for the landing page, but
now we should see when we go to actually
create a wireframe for our command
center, let's call it. Then actually
this time is going to ask us questions
and be really interactive, and it's one
of the other benefits of using something
like Claude Design. So, if we hit
create, and what we are effectively
going to do this time is create a mobile
app for something that we've built out
inside our community, which is the
agentic OS command center. So, think of
this as a UI that sits on top of your
terminal, where if you as a business
owner can just write down your
uh goals that you want to achieve,
similar to like you do in a terminal
window in Claude Code, where you type in
uh different tasks, but the difference
is that actually you can go into a
series of project tasks and see multiple
conversations under one hood. So, you
can see the progress of multiple chats
or multiple tasks which relate to a
single goal. So, it's like a way of
raising us above the individual tech
bits of tech overhead like GitHub
commits etc. to just focus on literally
different goals. All I'm going to do is
actually screenshot this right now and
what we're trying to design is an app
interface, a a mobile interface so that
users could actually use this on the
mobile. So right now it's just a desktop
interface. It works really well. People
are giving really good feedback but
actually nobody's able to use this on
their mobile at the moment. So I'm going
to actually go back into here and we're
going to paste in uh screenshots. We
want to make sure we connect it up to
the correct design system and what we
are doing
is yeah, pasting in screenshots for this
wireframe and then we will give it a
brief. But we're going to keep it a bit
more open this time and it will come
back and it will ask us questions and we
can obviously also point it to the to
the code too. I don't want to take up
too much context of it reading the whole
code base. So what I'm going to do is
just give it a couple of screens and
then ask it to design how it would
actually view these screens on mobile.
So we're going to give it the main
screen and we're also going to give it
the scheduled task screen where we
create different scheduled tasks that
can run on repeat without a user having
to touch them. And we're just looking
for effectively a design wireframe. So I
want you to help me build out a
wireframe for a mobile app or just a
mobile interface, a responsive design
for mobile for a product that we've
launched inside our Agenty Academy
called the command center and I'm just
basically attaching all those screens
making sure again we are prescriptive
enough that it's not going off the rails
and we don't need to use loads of tokens
to get it back in the right direction
but still open enough that it's going to
come back and actually use the
interactive feature to come back and ask
us questions like what do we actually
want the mobile app to do? And you can
see right now it's already mapping out
the different questions it has. So this
is like a planning stage that's really
useful inside this
uh inside Claude design. That helps us
feed more context in and get a design
that's more accurate straight off the
bat rather than having to rework a lot
of different things. And of course, it
does this as well inside the Cloud code
terminal, but this is laid out in a
really nice manner and relates directly
to our design. So quick questions on the
command center mobile wireframe, do I
want it to be like a sketchy hand drawn?
I'd quite like it to be closer to the
real design system. Which screen should
I wireframe? Pick all that apply. So
let's do the feed, let's do the goal
detail, let's do the schedule job jobs
list and skills list and skill detail
edit. How many variations per screen? So
this is really powerful. We can
basically ask for multiple variations
per screen so that we can choose from
those. So let's do two variations per
screen in in the order of preserving
our tokens. What should variations
explore? Probably navigation pattern. In
fact, decide for me, I'm not exactly
sure. Any nav pattern you already
prefer? No preference. How important is
the workspace switcher on mobile? That
is the workspace switcher between
different client folders. So this is
really important. How should a user
start a new goal on mobile? Persistent
composer bar at the bottom maybe. So
like a chat window at the bottom. You
can see these are really in detail
questions that are really making me
think about the design and that is the
purpose of this design planning. Feed
grouping on mobile. Decide for me.
Create job on mobile. Decide for me. We
want to view the skills that's most
important, but we also want to edit the
skills. What should tweaks let you
toggle? We're going to explore the
feature of tweaks. So tweaks are
something that's going to show up in the
design previews that's going to allow us
to actually flick between two things. So
light and dark screens,
sketchy versus clean stroke, variations
per screen, density. So let's just do
light and dark and sketchy versus clean
stroke. We can also suggest other
things. How should screens be laid out
in the deliverable? All variations side
by side on one infinite canvas. Yeah, I
like that. Device frame, let's go for
iPhone. Do you want annotations and
callouts? Yeah, let's have callouts. And
anything else I should know? No, let's
just go ahead with it and let's check
in. We're at 38% used on our Cloud
Design. Let's see where we get to by the
end of this wireframe. So, right now
we're seeing exactly how each step, now
that we've got the design system, is
actually affecting our contacts and
token usage. But, based on what everyone
said so far, I'm actually quite
impressed with the lack of token usage.
I guess I'm on the max 20 X plan, so if
you're on the pro pro plan, you would
have blown through your usage by now,
but I've been able to do quite a lot so
far back and forth because I've done the
upfront planning in the design system.
So, we had the landing page, which was
really scoped out, and now we've got the
wireframe, which is much less scoped out
and it's asking us those questions and
giving us the ability to actually decide
on the design direction, which is really
cool. This is the stuff that you don't
get inside the Cloud Code
interface at the moment, for example.
Okay, so we are at 42% used now, so that
took around 4% to make. And we'll have a
look through those, but I just want you
to remember also that the power in using
something like Cloud Design is that you
get all the files in the background. So,
if you ever want to take these projects,
you've effectively created the
underlying HTML and CSS files, which is
brilliant. It's just a way to actually
see that code translated in this
preview screen, I guess we can call it.
And you've got the Command Center mobile
wireframe. I like how this is totally
different. Like, this is like a canvas
view like you'd see in Figma versus what
we saw before, which was like more like
a web page HTML preview, scroll down.
This one is like literally like a canvas
view where we can like drag and drop
things around. Like, they're quite
rigid, but we can like, you know, swap A
and B if we wanted to. And it's got a
little summary like a read me at the
top. So, mobile wireframes for Agent Q S
Command Center, two variations per
green. A sticks to the desktop mental
model. B reframes for one-handed mobile
use. so quite like that. Fonts and
colors come from the Agent Academy
design system, great. Everything else is
intentionally low detail to keep
structure in focus. So, you can see that
we've got a few things that we've not
seen before. On the right-hand side,
we've got these tweaks. This is an
awesome feature that basically allows
you to do like a a switch between
multiple settings. So, say we wanted
dark theme instead and we wanted to see
those in dark theme, then we could see
that very easy. Say we wanted the
sketchy style versus clean style. I
quite like this clean style. And say we
wanted to remove notes entirely at first
and then put the notes back on. Let's
have a look at the individual screens.
And one thing you can immediately see is
that it's not quite nailed the iPhone
screen here. So, we have A for the feed
view. And if we go back and see the feed
view, the feed view is where we
effectively assign different tasks and
goals. You can see everything's a bit
cramped. We've got all of our categories
up there, which we can probably remove.
They look a bit nicer up here. Okay,
this isn't categories up here. This is
like redesigned. Yeah, I like this a bit
more. This is redesigned for the mobile
view, B, remember. We've got like five
in review, eight done, six scheduled
tasks. The notes are a bit all over the
place, so we can get it to actually try
and fix the formatting. I like that
we've got like the new goal you could
type in down here. You can select the
model. It's taken some of the text from
what it's seen in the screenshots. Like
this feels like a mobile view and this
this doesn't. But the cool thing is like
it's giving us variations. You don't get
this in many tools. Like Cloud Design
has given us with 4% context usage like
variation, two variations per screen.
And we could ask for five variations per
screen. And this really acts as the seed
for us to start thinking, "Okay,
actually I quite like that view, but
here's what I'd change instead." And
obviously the formatting's a bit off.
We've got like the standard time and
battery up there and then it it crosses
over. But like when you look at the
screens, they're not too far off. So, on
the goal detail where we actually enter
the goals, similar to what we do up
here,
we've got like enter your goals, then
you've got the activity, you've got the
files, everything that we've got inside
there and some pre-written tasks, too,
and the ability to reply, so like a chat
interface, like we're used to, which is
cool. We've then got these scheduled
tasks, and again, when it's just
replicated the dashboard, it looks
pretty poor, but when it actually thinks
about the design of a mobile app, it
looks significantly better and
significantly more optimized. Then
browsing skills, that's great. You can
toggle the skills on and on, but that's
not really a thing, but
yeah, I like the way it's it it's able
to search skills, add skills, etc. And
then we've got the skill detail where
you're able to actually go into raw or
preview mode and see the skill detail.
So, I really like this,
um and there's no individual tweaks that
I'd make, but let's see if it can clean
up the formatting. The formatting is a
bit all over the place. The notes aren't
really showing. The header crosses over
with all the iPhone functions, so can
you just clean them up a bit? And also,
I think, like, can we do a variation
again on B? So, we do a C variation, but
based on B, because B is like the best
style for each of the different screens.
So, we've asked it to do another
variation, and let's just uh take a
picture of the formatting as an example
and paste that into the chat. Send that
in. Let's see if it can clean up the
formatting, and let's see if by talking
to it, we can actually get it to do
uh a C variation, which is a variation
on, you know, most of these. And the
power in doing something like this, as a
non-technical person, as a non-designer,
I could hand this off to a developer,
and they've already got the code or like
the startings of the code to actually
develop these screens. But the other
benefit is I don't need to be a designer
to actually mock this up in an
incredible speed. This took a couple of
minutes to get to this stage. How many
hours would this take even a designer to
get to this stage, never mind a
non-designer? So, it's a really powerful
tool for that. Okay, so after that,
we're at 54% used, but this is actually
nailed it. It's added a section C or a
variation C rather. So, we've got B and
C now, and it's cleaned up all of the
notes, so we can actually see and
understand the different notes on here.
We can obviously hide the notes too, if
we wanted to. But, what we can see with
this second variation is a change in
style. So, you can see these are very
rounded, but this is more of a drop
style on there. It's filled in some more
detail around Okay, these are done
tasks. These are in progress tasks. So,
that's great. This doesn't really make
sense for the context. Like it's added,
you know, a marker on which model
it is, but it's got like the little send
or approval buttons in there, which is
quite nice. We've got like a backlog of
runs on the YouTube newsletter scheduled
task. Also great. And it's tried to be a
bit more creative here. It's got like a
featured skill of the week. Maybe that's
one we've used most. I mean, I like it.
It's It's a bit different. Recent
activity strip. Jump back to skills in
use. Okay, so maybe it's saying if you
if you jump back a page, it'll go back
to a skill in use. So, I'm not not
exactly sure. Category pills at the
bottom of each group. Again, I I feel
like some of these are not
related or like the notes are in the
wrong place maybe. Like category pills
at the bottom of each group, that makes
sense down here.
Um but, it's it's up here on the design.
But, anyway, the point being like it's
come up with a second variation when
we've asked it to. So, it's not perfect,
but like we said, we're aiming for like
a 90% version that we can take forward.
So, I think this one has shown us some
really good features, and we can
probably move ahead now, take the design
system, and start working on some
slides. So, let's go back to the design
app. And what we can actually do is
either go in and create a slide deck
directly, and we can actually give it a
project name, and move forward with some
specific notes on these slides. Or, we
can take a tip that I saw from Peter
Yang, which is actually if you want to
make really dynamic slides, then start
by asking Claude to design to actually
generate a video and then work it back
into slides. So, if you ask it to create
a slide deck, it's going to create
something quite boring and generic and
quite static, but videos are meant to be
dynamic and motion full. So, what we are
actually going to do is ask it to
generate a video first, and then from
that video we will duplicate the project
and ask it to actually then generate the
slides. So, I don't personally do a lot
of sales or pitch decks, but one thing
that I do do or enjoy doing is like
posting LinkedIn carousels for example.
So, for me personally, I'm going to go
and take a LinkedIn carousel, one that
I've previously posted, and ask to
actually translate that content into a
video. And therefore, hopefully we can
extract the information into a really
nice slide deck in this AgentSync
Academy uh slide system. So, we're going
to call it LinkedIn carousel, and of
course it's not going to be a good fit
to post on LinkedIn because it's not
going to be right format, but what we
can do is LinkedIn carousel slides and
the concept still carries through. So,
it's all about conveying almost like a
tutorial or a set of tips through some
slides instead of a LinkedIn carousel.
So, actually instead of LinkedIn
carousel, I'm just going to call it
carousel slides tips to use Claude code
for example. And we're going to create
that there. We're going to go to my
LinkedIn post, and it's all about tips
to use Claude code, and you can see that
it's you are using Claude code wrong, 10
config tips to go from chatbot to senior
engineer. Firstly, it talks about agent
teams, then it talks about built-in
slash commands, talks about actually
keeping context in various files
external to your Claude.md and not
overloading it, how to
access blocked sites, force it to verify
and fact check. And you can see these
have all got like annotated diagrams on
as well. And basically what we want to
do is take this content and turn it and
build it out into
a slide deck that has a little bit of
information, but it kind of is a bit
ambiguous. So what we're going to do is
go and grab the YouTube transcript from
the video that actually generated this
post that I reviewed and edited in the
first place. So I've now got the
transcript. I'm going to go back to
Claude Code and ask it to make a
animated video explaining the seven
levels that I explain in this video
transcript. And it's going to follow the
Agentech Academy design system. I'm
going to paste in the full transcript
and you can see that's pasted text
there. So what we're basically doing is
just make me an animated video
explaining this. And therefore it will
make not just a slide deck, but
effectively a full plan for seven
scenes, intro outro structure, starter
animations. So we're sat at 62% used
after it's generated that video. So
we've still got some capacity in here.
Let's have a look at what it built out.
You can see it's following the
standards. I quite like this how it's
laid out the slides. It's very
interactive. Shift plus tab to cycle
through modes. I quite like that. On the
right hand side it's got this coding
platform. It's going quite quickly. I
must say it's got a lot of information.
Claude that MD onboards your new
teammates. This is the structure of
Claude that MD. Didn't get time to read
it, but I like the way it's going. It's
definitely following the colors and the
design system, right? Three kinds of
muscle memory. This is like command
skills and hooks. Stop copying pasting.
Wire it up. Ooh, I like this. This is
cool. So it's adding animations, which
is great. It's taken the context of our
actual video, which was seven levels of
Claude Code. And this for example was
all about planning at scale. So like
splitting your plan into multiple
phases. So it's definitely taken the
essence of the text and turned this into
a really cool video, but what we want is
like slides that we can publish in
different places. So teams of agents,
it's showing multiple agents working.
Like this is a lot better than
I had expected it to be actually. I
wonder what this is using behind the
hood. The route loop, so it's like
autonomous loops as well. The seven
levels and then it lays out the seven
levels. Skip the trial and error. Pick
your next level. Ship it. I like it.
It's on brand. It feels very
appropriate. So, what we're going to do
now is show you how to turn this into a
slide deck. So, if we go share,
duplicate project, then you can see you
can duplicate things as templates, too.
And what I'll just do now is actually
say, "Can you turn this into a slide
deck instead of a video that I can click
through,
toggle through basically?" I also want
to include some screenshots of each
level. Like it's a bit overwhelming with
the information on each slide. So, I'm
going to include three screenshots for
levels 1, 2, and 3 that you can put into
the slide instead of like overloading
information. Just keep the key points.
So, I've taken three random screenshots
there. I've asked it to turn it into a
slide deck. Two of them are Boris
Cherney tweets. One of them is just like
a Claude code/commands file structure.
So, let's see how well it does in
actually converting that and whether it
can actually contextualize the images
that I've added and put them in the
right place. Who knows? We'll see. So,
it seems to have created it now. So,
let's go full screen and have a look
through. So, we've got the toggles down
here that we can click through. So, this
looks exactly the same as the video so
far. So, we've got prompting with
intent. Fan mode is read only. Claude
researchers and propose a plan before
touching a single file. Shift and tab
press twice to enter the plan mode. That
is true. And then it's got a few tips
there and it's got Boris Cherney's post
as a tweet as well, which is cool. It's
like reformatted that to be a tweet.
Level two, teach it how you work. So,
we've again got the tweet from Boris
Cherney on the right-hand side, which is
quite cool. So, it's understood that it
belongs with that slide, maybe because I
told it that it was going to be for, you
know, sections 1, 2, 3. And then we've
got a few key tips there. We've got a
blurry image on the right, but you know,
it can't help that I've uploaded a
blurry image. Three kinds of muscle
memory, stop retyping from the same
prompts, commands you invoke, skills
Claude invokes, hooks fires after. So,
this is this quite cool and I love how I
do love the formatting I must say. Stop
copy and pasting, wire it up. So, this
is like wiring up to MCP servers and
we've got the Claude code MCP bridge and
then all of our services there. Planning
on steroids and we kind of like made
this a bit more dynamic where this is
done, this is done, this is running.
Repeat per phase, plan, execute, verify.
Very cool, I like that. And then
multiple agents and I like how this
one's actually changed the the format a
little bit. So, one Claude Claude
researches, another one writes, a third
reviews in parallel. And I like how this
is almost like a story. You've got
researcher, writer, reviewer and writer
number two. Set it up, walk away, come
back to a week of work. And this is the
Ralph loop, level seven, the seven
levels and we kind of finish there. So,
it's kind of lost a little bit of the
dynamic nature of it, but to be honest,
I'm actually pretty impressed with where
we've got to in terms of just creating a
slide deck from a video there. We could
go back and actually ask it to add in
some more animations and make sure the
animations
keep, but I'm pretty happy with the
outputs. So, let's just have a quick
recap on what we did because it was a
lot. We built basically a full design
system for the Agent Academy and
hopefully you were able to follow along
at home and build your own too. So, we
built a community landing page based on
our ads page that we currently got up
and we built that using several
different methods. So, the first is we
actually used the skill UI to emulate an
existing landing page and we saw how
Claude code performed on that versus
Claude design where we could iterate and
manipulate individual elements on the
page. We also went to ChatGPT's new
image model and we generated a design
system there and both of those design
systems that we created, we fed into
Claude design to actually do all of the
planning up front before we confirmed a
design system. And that's meant that
even with everything we've done so far,
we've still when we've created all of
that, only hit 70% of my max limit, even
though everyone online is saying they're
using all of their limits immediately.
If you're on the max 20x plan, you can
get a serious amount done as long as you
do the planning up front. And we also
ended up with pages that did not look
like AI slop at all. They looked very
professional, actually, and I was really
pleased with the way that they turned
out. And can actually go back and build
on those. Like we said, this is a 90%
version designed for you to then take
away and actually improve that 10%
whether that's handing it off to Claude
code or handing it off to an actual
designer or a developer. Whatever you
want to do, this gets us to a 90%
version. We were then able to go and
look at the command center that we
built, the Kanban UI interface, and even
create three variations of mock-up
screens for various screens inside that
app and how the user would interact with
it. There were a few iterations we had
to do back and forth, but we got there
in the end and we would be able to take
this design and actually start building
out an actual high-fidelity prototype
based as well. Finally, we talked about
some tips in how to create more dynamic
slides it using your design style. So,
the most important tip was actually to
create a video first and ask Claude
design to do that and then rework it
into a slide deck. And we ended up
pretty happy with a slide deck that
actually portrayed a subject topic and
seven levels of Claude code, which was a
repurposed video. So, if you followed
along, you have done actually a huge
amount here and congrats on getting this
far. I'm just going to finish off on a
few tips that we covered to
reconsolidate your knowledge on them.
So, firstly, always build your design
system first before anything else. So,
this is the most important tip that we
shared throughout the course because it
means that actually you are able to
extract those elements that look more
human beforehand up front, give those to
Claude, not use a ton of tokens, and
still end up with something that you're
actually proud to present. Number two
was banning certain things like the
inter prompt, no roboto prompts, no
generic gradients, no teal in the
design. And we helped to get to those
decisions because we actually used the
taste skill, which I'll link down below.
And that had a bunch of stuff that's
like generic AI Claude front-end design
skill vibes that we wanted to extract
and never have in our designs. Three was
using inline comments for edits. So,
don't fully re-prompt anything unless
you want to change the whole thing. Like
Claude design is designed to make it
really simple to just go on, click an
element, and actually comment and change
those. But, we saw the limitations today
of it not being able to create custom
graphics, something that we might have
to go to something like Figma or a
designer to actually create. And then
finally, when you're creating a deck, if
you want it to be a dynamic deck,
whether it's a sales deck or a carousel,
then actually start with a video first
and then convert it to slides
afterwards. And we saw some really cool
features as we went through, like the
fact Claude does ask us loads of
questions to gain more context for the
brief, the fact we're able to use these
tweaks, comment, edit, draw. All of
these are really powerful use cases of
Claude design, and I can only see it
getting better and more useful. And
hopefully, the token usage problem will
start to reduce as they free up more
resources to focus on things like Claude
design, and it becomes more powerful.
The one biggest limitation so far with
Claude design, one that we've worked
around today, is the fact that it does
not allow you to import your own custom
skills. So, we've had to do workarounds
by using a bit of Claude code, a bit of
Claude design in order to actually get a
design that we're really happy with. So,

our design courses amongst many other
guided builds as part of our Agentyc
Masterclass. If you're looking to master
Agentyc workflows and building with
Claude code, then you'll definitely love
