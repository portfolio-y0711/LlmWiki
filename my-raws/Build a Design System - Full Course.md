# Build a Design System - Full Course

What's up? In case you didn't know by
now, I build design systems for a
living. And about a year ago, I started
with this build a design system series
where I actually built a design system
across six or seven episodes. It was a
real simple design system, not like the
tutorials in our academy, but people
loved it. So, I actually went ahead and
refilmed the entire multi-eries tutorial
and I included it in this one video. So,
by the end of this video, you're going
to have a full set of design tokens, a
real simple starter design system, and
you're going to know how to publish
design systems and much more. Let's get
started. And if you're looking for a new
design system or you're looking to
uplift your existing design system, I'll
put a link below where you can come work
with myself and also the team. And if
you're a fan about what we're doing with
UI Collective, consider checking out UI
Collective Academy. I'll put a link for
that below with premium courses, premium
downloads, a lot more right now and a
ton more on the way. Be sure to check
that out because every purchase helps us
do more of this. So, welcome to the new
series on building a design system. And
I know like throughout 2020, what year
is it? We're 2025. throughout 2024 where
I was like releasing videos and just
building the core components. We're
still getting a lot of questions. So,
I'm going to film actually refilm this
series all in one clip, you know, how to
build every design system component.
Now, uh one thing I would like to call
out is what we're touching upon today is
building the framework for the
components. We're building the initial
components and their variants. If you
really want to master this concept,
okay, we do have a course on building a
more advanced design system on our
academy. But again, we're going to build
out every component that you might
possibly need as we did across like
seven or eight different episodes in
2024, all within this video. Okay, so
one thing I want to get started with
right away, design token setup
structure. Okay. Now, UI Collective has
evolved to the point where I see a lot
of other creators taking the things that
I teach and like releasing it on their
own channel using their own like ideas
and methods. Okay? And there's nothing
wrong with that. Like to each their own.
Like I I put this content publicly so
everyone can learn, right? Not just so
that I can benefit by any means. But as
part of that, a lot of a lot of these
creators because they don't live and
breathe design systems like I do is like
they're adding spins to some of these
concepts, but the spins aren't
necessarily right. Okay? They they
aren't thinking about specific use
cases, especially when it comes to
design tokens. Now, the design token
setup that we're going to build today is
relatively simple. It's going to get
your feet wet in design systems, okay?
And if you're building a design system,
this is probably a great place for you
to start. And you can get into some more
complex like theming and approaches in
other ways in some of our other videos.
We're just going to walk you through the
full process here. Okay. So, when it
comes to your design tokens are also
like your Figma variables. Okay. There's
a couple different approaches and I know
these slides here I stole from one of my
other videos earlier on. Um, but people
just said they loved the slides and made
sense so I'm reusing them here. Okay.
So, when it comes to setting up your
design tokens for your design system,
there's a three- tiered approach to
design token architecture and also a
two-tiered approach to design token
architecture.
We at UI Collective
use the three tier. Okay, we were using
the three- tiered approach long before
Figma variables became a thing. We're
using the the three- tier approach when,
you know, we were still using Token
Studio, like the Figma plugin to apply
our design tokens. We've been doing this
for like 5 years and we use the three-
tiered approach where we use a brand
collection, an alias collection, and the
maps collection
now. There are a lot of Figma kits out
there that use the two-tiered approach.
So, that's your primitive collection and
also your semantic collection. Okay?
Whereas the primitive is more like alias
and the semantic is more the map. It's
almost like they skip over the brand
collection or sort of merge like the
brand and alias collection together.
Again, we're going to look at what these
are. Okay. Now, a lot of popular design
systems use the Tuti approach.
It's not wrong, and if you're using it,
it's not wrong. So, don't think that you
need to rebuild your design system from
scratch by any means, okay? But there
are some limitations to using that
two-tiered approach, okay? Especially
when you're dealing with multiple
brands, and we're going to look at
multibrands probably the latter part of
this video. Um, but we're going to be
proceeding with the three- tiered
approach to our design token
architecture. So, because we're three-
tiered approach guys, okay, I don't want
to say like we coined the term, but
we've been like teaching people this for
like three years. Um, so this is like
our thing, you know. Um, so let's look
at our brand collection to start. Okay,
so your brand collection is really just
everything in its purest form. But
again, I know these I have some of these
slides in another video. People just
love the slides, so I'm using them here
too. Okay, sue me. Um,
so in your brand collection, it's just
everything in its purest form. In terms
of your colors, it's just like a hex
code, hex code, hex code, hex code. You
like you haven't even really named it
yet. Like you haven't named it like air
this or like default this, right? It's
just super simple. So in terms of naming
though is we tend to use what's called
like the 100 scale. So if it's a red
scale, it's red 100 all the way up to
700 with the higher the number, the
darker it gets. What this does is allows
us to be a little bit flexible, okay? Is
if later down the line when we're
testing our components for accessibility
and we see that we need a lighter shade
than a red 100, okay, to offer like some
contrast in order to pass wika
standards, what I can do is I can add a
red 50, which is lighter than a red 100.
Let's say I need a color that's in
between a 200 and 300. I can add a 250.
Okay, so it allows us to scale up our
design tokens. Now, also too inside your
brand collection, font weights, font
styles. Okay, this changes a little less
frequently um
just because like you know if you if
your brand when on earth would you ever
change like your parent fonts? That's
not going to happen. So we tend to store
this inside uh of our brand collection.
But if we were multibrand, we'd bring
that into our alias collection. Don't
worry, we're going to look at what that
means a little bit later on. Okay. So,
just as like um like type variables,
string variables, sorry, uh is what
inside our thing with variables is where
we would have those font weights and
also those font styles. So, like enter,
enter inter light, regular, medium,
bold, so on and so forth. And we're also
going to have one super large number
scale. What this is going to do is going
to help us maintain consistency. Our
text size, our spacing, and so much
more. And one thing that's important to
note is you are not yet assigning a
color, a role inside your brand
collection. Okay, what we do is we
actually apply that inside of our alias
collection itself. Okay, so I've used
this example before which is like think
of your brand collection as the roots of
a tree where your alias and map
collection would represent other parts
of the tree which we're going to look at
later. Okay? Because without strong
roots, your design system is not going
to have the foundation to grow. Okay?
So, your brand collection really is just
everything in its purest form that
serves as the foundation for everything
else that's going to come later. You
know, just a value of 25 in a scale, a
hex code of 797929,
a uh hex code of 000000.
Enter. Semi- bold. Okay. Just everything
in its purest form. Raw. Nothing has a
specific specific role. Nothing has a
specific anything yet. Okay? It's just
I've said it eight times. Everything in
its purest form. Let's now go ahead and
start to build out a small brand
collection that we're going to use to
apply to our components a little bit
later. Okay. So, what I have here are
just some sample scales. Okay. Just some
really common color scales here. And
honestly, I might even just get rid of
the pink just because it's not a use
case that we're going to really need.
And we might also want to get rid of
that yellow as well, just because it's
not going to be a color that we're
really going to need for really
anything. Okay, at the end of the day,
whenever you're building a design
system, okay, and what this is, this is
sort of like bare bones. Okay, this
design system is going to give you a
great great foundation for you to scale
up. Okay, so whether you use our some of
the tutorials on building an advanced
design system in our academy, if you
watch some of our other videos, we
actually build out some more complex
libraries, you can do that. But this is
a great like tutorial for anyone getting
started building a design system. Maybe
you need a refresher. Build-in
components. And again, this is like just
almost a repeat of a lot of our other
build a design system series tutorials.
Okay. So, one thing I would like to call
out here is if you think about UI
Collective as a brand, okay, we're this
purple. If you're on our website and
there's something wrong with the form,
you're going to hit an error. If
something's successful, you might see a
green. Text of course is going to be
gray. You might see an orange for
warning. And you might see a blue for
information.
What other kinds of colors would you
would you need?
Any ideas?
Not really. Like you in the grand scheme
of things, these are really the only
core scales that you need. Okay? At
least if you're getting started. Your
core brand color. Again, maybe you might
have a couple brand colors. Uh you might
have a red for error, green for success,
so on and so forth. So, you're just
getting started. Don't over complicate
your scale. When I The thing that I see
devel like designers do when they're
just getting started is they build like
400 different color scales with 900
colors each. Okay? That's not going to
help anyone, right? That's way too
complex. We don't we don't need to do
that. If you're getting started building
your design system, just start with your
base colors and a certain number of
colors in your scales and then you can
always scale up later. Okay, so before
we get into building the brand
collection, I want to show you how I
actually built out some of these scales.
So, sorry, I just made some tweaks to
this, but um I just added additional
scale element. Anyways, uh I'm going to
show you how I'm going to uh build out
these scales. Now, there are tools that
can help you do this. I'm kind of a nerd
when it comes to my scales and that I
like total control. Okay? I sometimes I
don't always trust like these color
pallet generators that are out there.
Like for all of my design system
clients, I really just do it myself. I
build all the scales myself. Okay? So,
what I do is like in the case of UI
collective, let's say like this here is
our core brand color. What I do to
generate the lighter and darker scales
is I first I make sure the page is set
to like a white background and then I
just play around with the opacity. So I
set this to like 80, this to like 60,
this to like 40,
this to like 20,
and then this to like 10.
And notice how the colors like match,
but we don't want colors with opacity
inside our scale, like our actual design
system scale. So, we really just color
match what that color is. So, by doing
that, we get rid of the actual like
opacity. Um, and we like create a nice
clean consistent scale. Okay. The same
thing going up, but instead of on a
white background, what you can do just
set it to black
and then just uh bring it to the front
just like that. And then still just
adjust the opacity. But it's still going
to get darker because instead of whiter
because it's on the opacity is dealing
with a black background. Okay. So,
that's how I build out these color
scales. Again, there are tools that are
that are out there that can help you do
that. I just personally just don't like
using them. Um, so if you do want to
build out your own scales, that's the
way that you can do it. Okay, so let's
go into our variables here and let's
like build out our brand collection
here. Okay, so when I say like variables
in their purest form, like you're really
going to see what I mean. Okay, so
color variable. Sorry, I don't know why
I thought about doing that. Um, there we
go. Let me extend this out. give us
ourselves some space here. So this is
going to be our purple. Okay. So
although it's like a UI collective like
primary colors, it's just going to be
our purple because it's in the brand
collection. But one thing I didn't do is
I did not rename this collection to
brand. Okay. Then what we're going to do
is we're going to set this uh if we
think about like the opacity. So these
all followed like 20% intervals.
So this here was like our let's see how
many we have. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 nine
colors. Okay. So, we're going to have
purple dash 100. Okay, we're just going
to duplicate this nine times. Eight and
then nine. And then just rename them.
Okay. Uh 300, 300,
500,
600, 700, 800,
700, 800, and then 900. But what's an
issue with this
is that
all of the scales followed a 20% opacity
interval
except one which is the last one. So
could that be a nice crisp clean, you
know, 100 value if it didn't follow the
specific 20% interval? Okay, this is
just how I do things, okay? is if it
follows the interval that I start with,
whether that's a 10% interval or a 20%
interval, is I assign it a 100 value. If
it doesn't follow that, if it breaks
that logic where it starts to follow a
10% interval, it can't be a nice 100
value. Okay. So, what we're going to do
then is we're now going to shift is if
this is our lightest and this was only
actually built using a 10% interval.
Okay. What I mean by that, okay, again,
is if I take if I close this, and this
is where things can kind of get
confusing, is if I take this, which is
our core color, and then I set this to
simply 10%. And then this to 20%.
Notice how these initial colors follow
that nice crisp, clean interval, but
this last color doesn't follow that
pattern. So these here would be the 100
values, but this one would have to be a
50 because it went down half of 20 to
10. So here we had 20%, here we had 10%.
If you have any questions on that, leave
a comment below. Okay, so instead of
having a 900 value, all of a sudden,
what we're going to do, we can delete
that, but just at the end here is we're
going to have Oops, sorry. I don't know
why I did that. is we're going to have a
50 and that 50 is going to represent the
one that had just a 10% opacity
decrease. Okay, that's something that's
important to call out. Let's look at a
quick example of that again. So, say we
want to add one in between our 40% and
our 20% opacity where we just take it
down 30. Okay? Then what we would do is
if we have we have our 50, we have our
100, then in between our 100 and our
200, we would include a 150 because it
went down just 10%. Okay, that's how I
like to keep things nice and organized.
Okay, I do know that can be a confusing
topic. So if you're confused, drop a
comment below, ask on our community
forum, and I'll get back to you. Okay,
so now that we have that out of the way,
let's go through and keep building out
the brand collection. So then what we
can do is we can just simply just use
our color matching tool and just color
match. Now, the reason why um or even
just select the color codes here, that
might be a little bit easier. And I know
this is a little bit tedious and but I
want to make sure that although this is
a simple design system, it's not going
to be the best looking design system in
the world. If you want to build better
components like our build an advanced
design system series on our academy does
cover that a little bit better. Um but
it's going to be a design system that's
going to get you started. Okay. But
we're going to talk about a lot of the
edge cases, how to build like some of
these basic more like skeleton
components, um, and things like that.
So, um, oops, I broke something there.
Um, again, I'm doing I'm doing this
individually, building out each of these
scales, copying the hex code, so you can
slow down the video and follow along
with us. Okay, so there's our purple out
of the way. Now, let's just simply, we
can just duplicate this group. Just call
this our red.
And then we can simply just uh color
match. Okay, maybe work from the top
down.
There we go. So again, slow down the
video if you want to.
There we go. And I hope I didn't make
any mistakes here along the way. And if
I did, feel free to call me out.
There we go. Now, let's duplicate this.
Let's go with a green.
Same thing. We'll work from the bottom
up.
And big shout out to everyone who's like
purchased our academy. Oops, there's a I
noticed a mistake here. Um,
sorry. When I was building out these
scales in preparation for this video, I
made a couple mistakes. There we go. So,
forgive me there. There's probably a
couple more mistakes somewhere here,
which there are. So, we're just going to
corre correct these.
Sorry. I try my best sometimes, but
sometimes my best isn't good enough. It
looks like the labels are are right,
though. So, we're just going to copy uh
the labels here.
There we go.
Yeah, big shout out to everyone who's
purchased our academy. Um, really goes a
long way, honestly. Sorry, I know it's
kind of cheesy, but uh it is. There we
go. So, there we have our green.
And then what we're going to do is we're
going to duplicate this. And we're just
going to call this like our gray. Does
gray have an A or an E? I don't know.
Sorry. Grammar. Grammar was never my
strong suit.
There we go.
We're rocking and we are rolling, my
friends.
Perfect. There we go. So, there we have
our gray. Let's duplicate this. And this
here is going to be our orange.
And we'll go from the top down this
time. Oops. Sorry. I don't know why I
did that. Let me just copy this in
again. Slow down the video if you'd like
to. And uh looks like a little dark
honestly, but it's okay. We're going to
pretend everything's fine.
Slow down the video if you want to copy
the hex code. Sorry, I know I've said
that a million times.
And let's just duplicate this. And this
here is just going to be our bloop.
Oh, sorry. I don't know why I did that
again.
There we go. Copy in.
Copy in.
Copy in.
Copy in.
Copy in.
Copy in.
Copy in.
And copy this in. And there we go. Okay,
we're rocking and we're rolling. So, we
start we start to have like our brand
collection all set up now. Uh, but we're
still missing a couple things from our
brand collection. At least we have our
colors, but we're still missing like our
scale and also our font weight and like
our font uh type as well, our font
style, I guess, uh, you could say. So,
we're still missing that. So, let's look
at that next. So, now what we're going
to do is we're going to use like um or
start to build out sort of our fonts in
here. Okay. So, what we can do is we
just group these into um,
sorry, what's going on here? Actually,
no. Sorry, I'm not going to do that.
Let's just go to our all variables and
let's just create a string variable.
Okay, that we're going to call our font
weight. Uh, okay. And then enter. Okay.
Now, when it comes to uh what's going on
here, sorry, let move that out of the
way. Is when it comes to fonts. Okay.
So, I already have enter selected. So,
let me just zoom this in. Let me center
this just so we can see it. Okay. When
it comes to your font weight, the name
of your font is going to be the value of
the font. So I'm going to go ahead apply
a variable here that's going to be
enter. Okay, that's that easy. Okay, so
now I can see there's a connect between
the font and Figma. Okay, so it's
telling me that enter is applied. It
recognizes enter as a font. Uh what I'm
going to do is I can also uh do
something like popins. And this is where
you can get into like more specifics. So
maybe like enter is for you know your
headings uh and poppins is for uh your
text. Okay. And still because there's
it's not crossed off here, you can see
that there's a there's a connection
between them. Okay, if I was to call
this enter
one in 1R, you can see how there's no
longer a connection there because
there's no font that's called this. But
when I change this back to enter,
all of a sudden there's a connection
again. Okay. So then we can set this to
body. You can also get into things like
caption and stuff here as well, but like
we're not going to worry about that now.
We're just going to worry about getting
you a starting design system and
teaching you concepts along the way so
that you can scale up. Okay, but maybe
for now we have headings and body. What
we're going to do, we can just duplicate
this and maybe just go our font. Um,
we're sorry, let me uh confirm something
here. Sorry, this is font family, not
font weight. Sorry, hands up. That's on
me. This here is font weight. Okay. And
then for font weight, if I was to detach
this, okay, your font weight would need
to match what's here. Okay, you can't
have like just SB for semi- bold uh as
the value. It need to match the weight
of the font. So, uh here we can have you
know like regular, medium, medium, and
then bold. And it would need to match
the naming here. Okay, so this here
would be regular. This right here would
be medium.
And then this here would be bold. Really
that simple. And you can also even add
maybe just like a semi
sorry we don't have we have a medium but
we also have a semi bold. So let's also
maybe go with a semi-bold as well. Okay
semi- bold and then semi uh bold. Okay
that simple. So there we have the
specific values. And if I was also to go
ahead again and apply you know uh enter
for our body because this is maybe 12
pixels tall. And if we were to apply a
variable here as well we could apply the
medium. I can see it because it's not
crossed off that Figma sees the
connection between them. Okay. So, when
it comes to setting up your font family,
font weight within your brand. There you
have it. So, now that we have that out
of the way, let's look at like our
scale. Okay. So, what your scale is, and
this is a little bit more of an advanced
topic. Um, so what your scale is just
one large number scale that's really
just called scale and let's set a first
value of like zero. So anytime you have
a number variable
later on is you're going to pull from
this one scale. Okay, for things like
your width, your radius, spacing,
padding, gap, all that fun stuff. Okay,
generally always comes from this scale.
Okay, this is an advanced concept and
only really advanced design systems end
up like maintaining consistency in their
scale. Well, absolutely everything with
a number is a like comes from that
scale. Okay, I don't think we're going
to do that for this video. It's going to
take too long. It's a little bit
tedious. Um, but if you do want to go
that route, anytime you use a number,
whe once we get into the responsive
collection, um,
all those numbers should pull from one
parent scale. And in your brand
collection is where we house that scale.
Okay. So, the way I like to do a scale
is I still of course like to follow that
100 that 100 approach. Okay. Um, so this
is our 100 scale value. Very similar to
what we did with colors. But the only
difference is is that whereas with our
colors, those each each of those clean
like 100 values had to do with an
opacity, our 100s now are going to deal
with a multiple of four. Okay? So 100,
our 200 is going to be eight.
Our 300 is going to be 12. Our 400 is
going to be 16. Our 500 is going to be
20. And I'm I'll answer your questions
in just a sec. I have I'm about to pause
this and walk you through some use
cases. Our 600 is going to be 24. Our uh
700 is going to be 28. I hope I didn't
mess up here. If you did, feel free to
call me out. And then our 800 is going
to be 32.
Okay.
Now, right away,
you're probably wondering, Kirk,
where's like a one, like a one P point
border radius is pretty common, right?
Absolutely. So, if that's the case, what
we can do, we can apply a 25 that has
the value of one. And even like a two
pixel border width for something like a
focus, we can apply the value of 50. And
that would be a two. There we go. We've
covered some common use cases here. Now,
a lot of other creators who watch some
of my other videos, they start saying
that it's so it's no problem if you just
add just like a three in here, okay?
It's just weird if you do, okay? Because
everything should be this nice, crisp,
clean, even number. It's very rare for
you to sort of mix odd numbers with even
numbers. So, I wouldn't suggest it at
all. Okay? Now, one thing you can do as
well is you can start to get kind of
fancy because let's say like you have
widths that go up to like 256.
256 / 4. If I bust out my handydandy
calculator, 256 / 4 is equal to 64. That
means we have need to have 64 values in
our scale. No need for that. Okay?
You're not going to use all those
colors. So once you get to a certain
point, not going to use all those like
scale numbers. Sorry. So once you get to
a certain point, you can kind of just
like increase your number but still
stick to that 100 value. So maybe from a
32 we want to go to 40. That can be a
900. As long as it still follows that
four pixel scale, you're fine. A,000,
you know, maybe we go with a 48. Okay?
You know, an 1100 maybe right now
because we don't want to have anything
in like the 50s. Maybe this you just
jump right to a 64. Okay? So we might
come back and adjust the scale a little
bit later, but that's a real like
starting let's like a scale in a
nutshell. So now we can apply things
like our border widths, our border
radiuses once we get into a responsive
collection as well. Well, you know, some
of our font styles and stuff might be
here too. So now I want to look at the
alias collection. And your alias
collection is where you're breaking out
colors into into categories. Okay, again
I know these slides are from another
video, but anyways, people loved them.
So here they are again. Okay. So where
we have like red 100, 200, 300 in your
alias collection, you're assigning those
scales to specific role. So things like
error, like primary, you know, success,
warning. Okay, these variables aren't
yet applied to our components, but we're
starting to really start to theme them
out. Okay, so we do this ultimately to
maintain consistency. So as this
example, as we have this error alert
right here. Okay, this error alert
should pull from the error scale, not
the primary scale. Because if everything
that's red pulls from an error scale,
it's going to confuse our developers
because everything's going to be in an
error state. Okay. And that's the case
of just we have two colors like our
primary and our error both share are
both red. Okay.
Uh alias is also where we define all our
other miscellaneous variables like our
border radius and our border width. And
it's also where we define another brand.
Okay. And we're going to look at that as
well. Hey, what's going on? Thanks. so
much for watching and making it this far
in the video. Look at this. I got the
sunshining on me here. Uh if if you're
grateful for what we're doing at UI
Collective and want to support myself
and the team, be sure to check out our
UI Collective Academy. I'll put a link
for that uh down below. So, back to a
tree example is,
you know, your alias collection is where
you start to get into like um
like like the trunk of a tree where
whereas our mapped collection that we're
going to look at is more like the like
the leaves of a tree that branches out
all these like great awesome visuals
that everyone can see from far and wide.
we need to be able to connect our brand
collections. So the foundations to those
specific variables and that's the
purpose of like our alias collection is
it's more of a tree trunk than anything
else in helping us sort of get to that
beautiful final state. I know this is
confusing but bear with us. Promise you
it's going to make sense. Okay. So now
let's look at uh building out our alias
collection. Okay. So when it comes to
your alias collection is what we're
going to do is we're going to start
applying roles to some of our scales.
Okay, let's look at what I mean by that.
So let's start off with our primary. If
we go into our brand, in the case of UI
collective, this purple is our primary
color. So in our alias, we are going to
apply that the role of primary.
So what we can do now is just duplicate
the exact same scale that we had before.
So, we had a 100, 200, 300, 400, 500,
600,
700, and then 800.
Then what we're going to do is we're
just going to create the alias and
connect back to our primary color like
our and our purple color inside of our
brand collection. Sorry. So, uh, create
the alias. This is going to be our 300.
Sorry. This is going to be our 200. This
here is going to be our uh 300. This
here is going to be our 400. This here
is going to be uh our 500.
This here is going to be our 600.
This here is going to be our 700. And
then this here is going to be our 800.
Okay. So when it comes to your alias is
that is really all we're doing is we're
just taking the scales that are inside
of our brand collection and really just
at the end of the day just assigning
them a role. Okay, let's keep looking at
some more examples. So if I was to
duplicate this now think about the case
of like um our error. Okay, same thing.
Just adjust it to the red. Red 200, red
300, sorry, red 100, red 200, red 300,
red 400,
red 500,
600,
700,
uh, and then our red 800. Okay, let's
duplicate this again. What was the next
color that we looked at? It was our
green. Okay, our green is going to be
our success. So here what we're going to
do is we're going to apply a green.
We're going to apply a green and apply
the green all the way down. Really that
easy at the end of the day. Nice and
easy, right? Perfect. 500
600
700.
And then we have uh our green 800. Then
if we were to duplicate this, what's the
next one that we had, which is our gray.
Now our gray because it like the role
can vary as to what that gray is for. It
could be for icons. It could be for
text. It could be for headings. So the
way we classify that is actually a
neutral. So this is a 50. This here is a
100. This here is a 200. This here is a
oops a 300. This here is a 400. This
here is a 500. This here is a 600. This
here is a 700. And then this here is an
800. Okay? Really that simple. Then
let's go into our brand. The next one is
our orange. So if we were to duplicate
this, this here is where we would have a
warning. Okay. So our warning is our 50
warning 100, warning 200, warning 300,
warning 400, warning 500,
warning 600,
warning 700,
and then our warning 800. This connects
back to that orange. If I made any
mistakes here, call me out. And then
let's go with our blue. So our blue is
generally our information. So if I
duplicate this, call this our
information.
Okay. So this here is our 50. This here
is our 100. This here is our 200. This
here is our 300. This here is our 400.
Oops, sorry. This here is our 400. This
here is our 500. This here is our 600.
This here is our 700.
And let me move my video bar out of the
way. And then we're going to have our
blue 800. Okay, so just like that at the
end of the day. Okay, beautiful. Um, so
now let's go into uh our border widths
and also our border radiuses. So now
let's look at our border widths and our
border radiuses. So we're going to add a
number variable. Border widths um border
widths. Sorry, let me check my cheat
sheet here so I don't uh lead you
astray. Our border width and near one
here is going to be none. Okay. So, when
it comes to the none value, what this is
going to do, it's just going to be
connecting back to that scale. Okay.
Now, for our border widths is like
there's really no purpose for like a 100
scale because we only have a couple of
them. So, that's where we can start to
get into something things like small,
medium, and also large. Okay? But to
each their own. So, that small would be
a 25, which would be one. You know, that
medium might be two like two pixels.
Maybe you have like a larger component
where there is a little bit of a larger
border width, which would be that 100.
Okay. So, let's duplicate this and let's
do the same thing for our border radius.
Okay. So, a border radius maybe you
might have a button that has that nice
crisp clean right angle. That would be a
zero. You might have, it's very rare
actually to have like a one pixel border
radius. Usually, you always just have a
two. So, what we're going to do, we're
actually just going to delete this. This
here is then be going going to become
our small. This here might become our
medium. And then we might have a large
um with like an eight border radius or
something like a larger card or table
component. Okay. So there we have our
border width and also our border radius.
So I want to cover multibrand design
systems. Okay. Because your alias
collection is is where those multibrands
are housed. So there's a couple
different approaches to multibrands and
it really depends on like your company,
your use case as to what approach that
you should follow. It's a question I get
all the time. So I want to look at
what's called a branded house approach
first. Okay. Sorry, these are from two
images uh merged into one. So your
branded house approach,
branded house approach,
I set this to like 64. There we go.
Sorry. Is where
within one house you have brands that
are like kind of the same. Okay. So,
what I mean by that is if you look at
Coke, Coke Zero, and Diet Coke, those
colors are all going to be relatively
similar, except there's just a primary
color that's a little bit different.
Okay? So, they're going to share the the
same scales at a high level, but
everything else like their fonts, like
their fonts, their uh border widths,
border radiuses, like their success
colors, those are all going to be the
same. The only thing that's different is
that there's just a different primary
color. Okay? That is what's called a
branded house approach. Now there's also
the idea of a house of brands. Okay. So
this is where if you think about the
CocaCola company, they have all these
different types of brands. So you have
the three that we saw before that are
similar, but Sprite has a completely
different color scheme than Coke.
Vitamin Water, uh, Monster, Powerade,
Dani, Dr. pepper. They all have
completely separate color schemes than
Coke. Okay? So, their primary color,
their secondary color, if they have it,
their text, radiuses, all their
components, everything is going to be
completely different. This is what's
called a house of brands. If you have a
house of brands approach, my suggestion
to you, have a separate design system.
Okay? One for each brand. The
alternative to that is is what you can
do is say you only have two completely
separate brands. You would rename this
to like brand Coke, okay? And then you
can simply duplicate this entire one and
create a new collection
called brand sprite. Okay? So, it's
still within one design system, but
you're just going to need to change the
collections that are applied. Okay?
That's my suggestion. It's the House of
Brands. Okay. So, if I was just to go
ahead and just uh delete uh this
collection now, but this is far more
complex. Okay. And if you're dealing
with a house of brands, like get in
touch with me, like you know, we have
some links where you can book me for
some time if you do need that level of
consulting. Okay? We work with house of
brands all the time. But the more common
use case that I work with like that I
see a lot of designers asking about is
this branded house because everything is
really just the same. So if you do have
this house of brand approach inside your
alias collection is where you're going
to house that that brand. So you're
going to have brand one, add another
mode that's brand two. Now everything
else is going to stay the same. Okay,
but the only thing that's going to
change is just the primary color. So
maybe for the second brand, this primary
color is going to be our red. We could
then go ahead and simply just swap out
the primary color. It's that easy when
dealing with a multibrand design system.
Okay. Now, we do have a full other video
that goes a little bit more in depth on
multibrand design systems. I'm not going
to do that here. Okay. But it's a it's a
question that I get all the time. It's
just dealing with multibrand design
systems, the different types of
multibrand design systems that are out
there. Okay? So, if you're dealing with
a house of brands, just inside your
alias collection, just add another mode
and swap that primary color or a
secondary color if you need to. Right?
But if you're dealing with a house of
brands, oh, sorry, I think I deleted my
image. Um, is, you know, get in contact
with me because there's probably a lot
of other use cases and edge cases that
you're not thinking about in regards to
that. Okay, my suggestion to you.
Anyways, let's keep moving forward. So,
one thing I always do as well is just
with inside of our neutral collection is
your black and white's never really
going to change. But one thing you can
do, sorry if I just remove the coke here
now,
is inside your gray, what you can do is
really just include like a white and
just like a black if you want to. Or you
can just like what I do sometimes is
just like in your all variables just
like create a new variable. You just
call foundation is where you just sort
of have like
um foundation white. Sorry, there we go.
Foundation white, black. It doesn't
really matter what you do here with some
of these things. But then inside your
alias, inside that neutral is where you
can also just have sort of like a white
and then also just like a black.
Okay, it's it's really that simple at
the end of the day where we search for
foundation.
And again, you can also just put this
inside of like an alias foundations
group, but like just for the sake of
everything, just if you just put it in
neutral, like it makes life a little bit
easier. Okay, so foundation black.
Foundation black. Okay, there we go. So
really we have all the variables that we
need inside of our alias collection
though. So now I have like slides for
maps but like I think it's best if you
just like if I go through it with you
and we build it together. But your
mapped collection is really like the
leaves of a tree. It's what everyone
sees. Okay. So these are your icon
variables. These are your text
variables, your surface variables and
your border variables in a nutshell.
Okay. So these are the things that are
actually applied to a lot of your
components. Now, one thing I would like
to call out is not every single one of
the colors that you had in your alias
collection needs a purpose in your
mapped collection. What you're doing is
you're selecting the specific variables
that you're going to want to use for
your components, even if it's just like
two colors from a particular scale,
okay? And applying them or giving them a
specific role um inside the maps
collection that's going to be applied to
a lot of these components. Okay? So, now
let's start off building out our maps
collection. Now, one thing I would like
to call out here, this token structure
is very simple. Okay, as I mentioned
earlier, this series or this long video,
we're not building the best looking
components in the world and we're not
covering every specific use case. Okay,
I do have more videos where we get into
more complex tokenography. Okay, but
again, this is just
getting your feet wet and it's the same
that was in the series last year. Okay,
so our maps collection, it's going to be
very basic, but this can get super
complex and I will leave links on those
some of those more complex videos below.
Okay, but I want to call that out
specifically is that this is a starter
video. It's not meant for you to build
the most robust design system in the
world. Also too, one thing I would like
to call out is that the naming
conventions that will go into your maps
collection,
they can vary. And I've covered a bunch
of different approaches before. I'm
using a a different approach to Star. If
you look at our collective kit that's
inside of our academy, um the token
structure follows a little bit of a
different approach, but it's more
complex. Okay, I want to call that out
right away just so there's no confusion.
So, with that preamble out of the way,
let's look at our mapped collection now.
Now, let's go ahead. Let's create
another collection that's going to be uh
our mapped collection. Okay, so we're
going to start off uh with our text
variables. So, starting off with our
text headings. Okay. So, with our text
headings, we're going to go into our
neutral collection and maybe just apply
like an 800. Okay. And then we're also
going to have a body and maybe we apply
that a 700. So, now we're starting to
have some of those different variables
for like our different like, you know,
styles and things that are actually
going to go onto or different colors
that are actually going to go onto our
like components and onto our text. Okay.
Again, as I said before, there are more
complex versions of this text where we
get into things like on color, on color,
subtle. Those are in another video in
our like our academy series. But again,
just getting your feet wet. This is the
approach that I would follow. Okay,
we're also going to have an action and a
um text action color. Think of it like a
link color. So, if there's a link in
like your your body, the paragraphs, and
what I usually do for that is, let me
just make sure confirm something here,
which is our 500. Now, one thing I
always like to do as well is whenever
I'm working within my scales uh in our
alias and like in our brand, whatever
like that default color is instead of a
500, you can call it a default. So, you
already know like what your core color
is that the scale was based off of.
Again, it's just something I do. Um you
don't really need to do it too if you
don't want to. So, this is our default.
And then this here is also our default,
whatever those 500s are, just so I know.
Okay. Anyways, so you have your text
action and because our primary like UI
collective color is purple, maybe I want
that link to be like a default. Okay, so
sorry, not a purple default. This should
be our primary default. Thanks for
calling me out behind the scenes. Always
be sure to um go al collection to
collection. Never skip over collections.
Uh then what we're going to do is we're
going to go with our action hover. So if
this action element was actually
hovered. So think like an like
legitimately like a link. The link is
the color the action color is if that
there's that link is not hovered. And
then when that that link is hovered
what's the hover color? Okay. And when
we build out these components you're
going to see uh what I mean. And we're
also going to need a text disabled.
Okay. So if that link maybe is disabled
in the grand scheme of things we can
apply like a neutral 400. We're also
going to need an information. So if like
you have text that's in an information
state, that can be our information
defaults. You can have a warning. So
again, a warning defaults.
Warning. So sorry, where's our warning?
Our warning defaults. Uh you can have
our success, which is our success
defaults. And then you can go uh with an
error,
which is our uh error default. And then
we're also going to need uh an onaction.
So basically what this is, again,
there's a bunch of different ways that
you can break this up. I have more
complex ways um in some of our other
videos, but a great great way if you're
just getting started is think about an
on action is if it's on color, right? So
if you have text that's on a colored
background, um you might just want to
set it to neutral
that neutral white. Okay. Um,
and I think we're pretty good when it
comes to uh our text. So, these are all
some of their starting text colors that
we might need for our design system. And
it's great because this can always scale
up. So, now that we have this out of the
way, let's move on to our surface, our
icon, and our border. So, now let's look
at our icons. Okay. Now, the be best
thing about this, if I was to duplicate
this group, our text group for icons,
basically all these variables can really
stay the same because we want some
consistency if our text is next to an
icon. Like if we have warning text next
to a warning icon, we want those colors
to be consistent. Okay? We don't want
them to be completely different because
that's where we get into some different
experiences. But where some things
differ is we're not going to have an
icon headings or an icon body. Okay?
What I'm going to do, delete one of them
and actually just call this our icon
defaults or our icon um primary is also
a term that you can use, but I find that
if you're using the action action hover
approach and you're applying a primary,
I think default is just a little bit
easier to understand. Or what this is is
if you just have an icon resting on its
own, um what's the color for that icon
that you want to apply? So, I'm going to
apply just a neutral 700 for now. But
everything else is really going to stay
the exact same because you want the text
and icons to share the same variables.
So, the easiest way to deal with your
icons, just duplicate the text group.
So, now I want to go into my surface
variables here. Um, or create surface
variables, excuse me. And what we're
going to start off with is actually a
color for a page. Okay. Now, with this,
we can connect back to our neutral white
because maybe we want our pages to be
white. Okay. Then what we can do is also
have what's called like a surface
primary or you might also know it as a
surface defaults. But what this is is
really what are the colors for like key
cards on the page. Okay. So in the case
of what I mean by that is say we have
like this dashboard here and then which
is white. Say we might have all these
cards on top of it, right? But maybe you
want the cards to have some type of like
subtle differentiation. So this is super
lightly. It's like let me just go like
2%. Sorry. Just so you can see the
difference. And that's way too dark.
Like 5%. Something like that. Whereas
like a very subtle difference in like
contrast from the background. Okay,
that's the purpose of what is like that
surface default. So it can be white if
you want. It can be gray. It doesn't
really matter in the grand scheme of
things. Okay. So what we're also going
to need is a surface action. So what the
surface action is is think about a
button. Okay. That's an action element.
That is our surface action. So in that
case, if we think back to our uh our UI
collective, our buttons are purple. So
we're going to apply that default. And
then we're going to apply the action
hover. And in this case, what we might
want to do is again just apply a little
bit darker color. So when that button is
hovered, it switches to a darker color.
Now, what we're going to do now is now
get into like more specifics like
success, like warning,
like uh oops, I don't want to open that.
um warning information. Okay. Um error.
Okay. With these, if you think about
like an alert as an example, and again,
there's a ton of different use cases for
these. Sometimes you might want multiple
success colors. If it's lighter, if it's
darker, depending on if you have success
success buttons, warnings, warning
buttons, so on and so forth. Okay? And
you might want different like groupings
for these, but for the purposes of this
video, let's just look at it from the
point of view of alerts. Maybe we want
these colors, these background colors to
be a little bit lighter. Okay, so
warning 50. Unless we get into alert
components, you might see what I mean.
Uh, our information 50 and then our
error 50. Okay, really, really, really
that simple. Perfect. So, there is our
uh surface colors. I hope I didn't mess
up anywhere here, and if I did, we'll
come back and fix it. Again, just our
starting surface colors uh for now. But
we might come back and add some more as
we go through and build out some
components. But let's look at our border
colors next. So now let's create a new
grouping for our border. Okay. So with
our border, we're going to start off
with like our border like a default or
like maybe like a primary if you want to
call it that. Doesn't really matter. But
what this default is if we think back to
the example where let me see if I still
have it here uh on our frame is if we
have sort of these cards, right? What's
sort of a standard border that's applied
to a lot of elements. Okay, this can
even be things like fields too. So I'm
going to create this uh and set this to
like a neutral 50 as an example. Okay.
So it just offers like some very subtle
differentiation um between a lot of
these things. So then what we can do we
can go with our like border success
information
information
uh warning uh error um disabled is
another big one. Actually did I even
have a surface disabled? I didn't add a
surface disabled so forgive me on that.
is we're also going to need a surface
disabled which is might be like a
neutral like I don't know 100 and we're
building a design system not the best
looking design system in the world.
Okay. Um so for these our border if our
um background for some of these elements
might be a little bit lighter maybe we
want our border to be a little bit
darker. So this will be our our success
maybe like 200 information 200 uh
warning 200 uh and air 200. Okay. Um,
what else? For our borders, we're also
going to need an action. And our action
for our buttons, I kind of like to have
like that the same as I did for the
surface. So, if our action is a surface
actions, the primary default action
hover is primary 600. I'm going to do
the same like action hover primary 600.
Um, we're also going to need a disabled.
Sorry, I skipped over the disabled
before, too. So, maybe they're neutral.
Maybe like a 300. And then we're also
going to need a focus. So our focus
element will go around our focus
components. Uh and this is always the
same as whatever that action value is.
Okay. Sorry, our default. Okay, perfect.
So we have a lot of our variables that
we can actually starting variables that
we can use to start to build a lot of
these components now. And again, this
can get way more complex and I've done
videos where this does get way more
complex, but in the purposes of building
out components, getting you started
because at the end of the day, most
people just want to see how we're
building components. Okay, we build
components the best way here at UI
Collective. A lot of other content
creators take influence in how we do
this. So, um, yeah, want to cover it
again. Perfect. So, now that we have
this out of the way, before we get into
our responsive collection, let's look at
what light mode and dark mode. So, now
light mode, dark mode. Everyone says
like, "Oh, Kirk, like dark mode's
impossible."
Not really. Dark mode is probably the
easiest thing that you're going to do,
okay? Because all you're doing for light
mode, dark mode is you're just inversing
the colors. It's that simple. So this
here would be our neutral 50. This here
would be our 100. This here might be our
400. But also too with dark mode,
sometimes you do want some of those
colors to stay the same. Okay? And if
your brand is like that, what you can do
inside of your alias collection, also
your brand collection, is just put like
a dashed fix. So that um
this is more like relevant for uh like
primary colors, secondary colors, those
core brand colors, things like error
success is a little bit more fluid is
you can put like a default fixed to let
any designer know that that color needs
to be cannot change okay across dark
mode. So maybe
sorry coughing for the purposes of this
exercise we're just going to set that to
default fixed. Okay, but everything else
we can kind of inverse. So, we're
neutral 400, neutral 700. Again, you can
kind of be like sloppy with this, right?
Like, it doesn't need to be super
perfect because we're going to go
through and test this for accessibility
a little bit later on. Uh, neutral
white, uh, our black, our icon. Sorry,
feel free to skip ahead here if you
really want to, but um, we're just going
to have some fun with it. It doesn't
need to be perfect. For some things, you
can just sort of select another value
and just see how it looks. And whenever
I build dark mode to start, this is
exactly what I do. Like I'm not even
kidding either. Like I just Sorry, our
defaults should probably be at 300, but
um I just go this fast and then like
work our way back and start to test a
lot of these components first to see how
things are looking. So our success 50
800 800 uh 800
800
neutral 700 almost there. Um, these ones
are easy. Success 200, 600. And again,
just guess at the end of the day is
really what you're doing.
Try to get it as close to as possible,
of course, but you're always going to
need to go through and test for
accessibility again anyway.
Default fix, default fix,
600, 700, doesn't really matter. Okay,
so there you have your starting point
for dark mode. Okay, so we have all of
our color variables out of the way. And
again, this isn't the most perfect
design system. It's not the best looking
design system, but it's enough where you
can take the learnings and apply it to
your own and really like upscale it in a
way. Okay, so we have our brand
collection. We have our alias
collection. We talked about multiple
brands. We have our maps collection that
looks at light mode and also looks at
dark mode as well. But what about like
our fonts and stuff? So that's where we
bring in the responsive collection. So
our responsive collection, it basically
just like houses all the variables that
might change across device sizes if that
makes sense. So things like our font
size, you know, and our spacing,
padding, gap, things like that. Okay. So
in let's start off with like our text
sizes. So in order to actually go ahead
and what's the word that I'm looking
for?
Um build out or type scales. Sorry, that
was so tough. It's 8:17 and I'm tired.
um is I use this tool called type scale.
It's going to help us build out this
type scale. Okay. So, what I always do
is I set our font size, basic font size
to 16. And what that's going to do is
whatever our basic paragraph size, it's
always going to be 16. Anything lower
than 16, you need to be careful from an
accessibility standpoint depending on
the font that you have. 16 and above,
you're always fine from accessibility
standpoint, unless your font is like one
pixel thin. Okay? But I've never seen a
font that's like that. Anyways, so then
we have all these different scales to
choose from. I'm going to select major
third to start and then also toggle this
to pixels because Figma works in pixels,
not rims. Okay, now what? Let's dissect
this for a sec. So, we have paragraph
size of 16, which is what we want. We
have an H6 of 20. Then we have an H5 of
25 and H4 of 31.25.
But we really don't want decimals inside
of Figma, do we? We want nice, crisp,
clean, you know, numbers. So what we're
going to do for this is we're actually
going to using the four pixel grid that
we had in scale. Okay, apply that same
concept here where
16 to 20 goes by four pixels. That's
perfect. But then we go to five. What's
the closest multiple of four? 24.
Then 31.25.
What's the closest multiple of four? 32.
40. 48. Um, oh god, 60. Right, these are
where we get into all like how we start
to build actually build out the scale.
It's just like round the number to the
closest multiple of four just for
consistency purposes. Okay, now um let's
go ahead and just like screenshot this.
And one thing I'm also going to do as
well is everyone asks about mobile. When
it comes to mobile, what you can do is
simply just select a smaller scale and
notice how everything shifts. Okay. So,
I'm going to take a screenshot of this
as well. Okay. There's our mobile scale.
Um, and now we're using can apply that
same logic where things just like adjust
as as needed. Sorry, things don't adjust
just adjust as needed. We just have to
keep applying that four pixel um logic.
So, closest multiple of four to 47.78 is
48. So, our H1 is going to be 48. Okay,
that's how we get our type scales in a
nutshell. But where things can get
complex are things like line heights and
um paragraph spacing. We're going to
look at that too. Okay. So with the
screenshots that we have, let's go into
a responsive collection and start to
build this out. So here I just have the
screenshots I took from Typescale for
like our desktop and mobile. Um let's go
ahead. I just created this responsive
collection here. And let's just go ahead
and start with our number variables, not
our string variables because I've done
this before with string variables and I
have to rebuild it with number
variables. So don't do that. Okay. So
we're going to start off with H1 and
then font size. Okay. This is a way that
you can approach it. There's a bunch of
different ways you can do this. So like
line height and then also like paragraph
spacing. Um and what we're going to do
is just duplicate this for um our H2,
H2, our H3,
H4,
our H5,
and then our H6
H6. And then what we're going to do is
we're going to for our um paragraph
x small
paragraph small
paragraph medium
and our paragraph large. Okay. So just
like that. And now let's go ahead and
add some adjustments here. So for H1 um
maybe we'll do our mobile after. So
let's focus on our desktop for now. Make
sure we get that that down pat. So, um,
what we're going to do here is is going
to be we're start our closest multiple
is, uh, 60 for this. I really hope I
didn't mess that up. Two is going to be
our 48. Our H3 is going to be our 40.
H3 is going to be our 40. H3 is going to
be our 40. Our H4 is going to be our 32.
Our H5 is going to be our 24.
24. And then our H6 is going to be our
20. And then this is where we're getting
into something some tricky things here.
Maybe if I go oops largest to smallest.
Keep things consistent. A large, medium,
small, extra small. There we go. We're
cooking. Awesome. So, our paragraph
large in this case is going to be 20.
And I know what you're saying is, Kirk,
like our Oops, I didn't properly H6. I
know what you're saying is like our font
size for H6 and our paragraph large are
the same. Yes. Usually with your
headings, it might be a little bit more
bold to offer that level of
differentiation. Um, but anyways, I
continue on. Our paragraph medium is
going to be that 16. And there's
different terminologies here for what
you can call these things. Okay? And
I've called them different things in the
past. Our paragraph small, we're going
to break the four pixel rule and
actually just go with the 14 parag
paragraph spacing is kind of weird that
way. And then something that is
absolutely not accessible, but I still
have it as an option for things like
captions or if I really really need to
like terms and conditions, you know, is
like that that font size of 12. Okay. So
now let's look at line height. Now when
it comes to line height is we might like
adjust this a little bit later on is
what you do is you kind of take the font
size and you multiply it by a multiple.
Okay 1.4 1.6 1.2 until you get the look
and feel that you're going for okay so
what I mean by that is like 60
60 * 1.2 2 is 72. So in this case, our
line height for H6. So if we set this to
hello world, hello world. If we set this
to like a 60. Okay. Oops. We set this
like a 60. Um, and we set our line
height to something like 72. That's what
that would look like. And it's not that
half bad. Again, what did I what was
this? 60* 1.4. If we go 60 times 1.2,
maybe we want might want things a little
bit tighter. Or sorry, it was You know
what? That's fine. before I get ahead of
myself here. Okay, you can also even go
a little bit tighter like 60 times 0.8
and have to set this to 48. But this
like a little bit too tight I find
sometimes, but it's totally up to you.
Okay, so this is where you kind of need
to have an idea as to like how you want
to structure your type before you go
ahead and do this. We're just going to
keep things simple. Go by 1.2 for now.
Okay, so lock height 48 * 1.2
um 57.6.
We're still going to apply that four
pixel rule here. So, which it would be
56. Yes, 56. I believe I got that right.
Please don't sue me if I got that wrong.
Uh, time 1.2 48. Perfect. 32 * 1.2 38.4
closest to 40. Uh, 24 * 1.2 uh 28 28
20 * 1.2 24. Perfect. Uh 20 24. Same as
before. 16
* 1.2 uh 20 uh 14 * 1.2 16 and then 12 *
1.2
14 16. Okay. So there we have our line
height. Okay. So let's go ahead and do
the same thing uh for mobile. Now before
we look at our paragraph spacing. So
this here is desktop. This here is
mobile. Okay, just like that. Um, one
thing also that we can do inside this
responsive collection is just create
another variable here that we're just
going to call like device size. So this
is where we can specify like what these
are like 1440 maybe this is like a 440.
Okay, for mobile you could have tablet
here as well. Okay,
so then for uh our mobile. Okay, so
we're have 48 um 48 1.2 do
50. This would be 56. Oops. 56. 56. Uh,
this here is going to be our 40. 40 *
1.2. I believe we already did that
actually, which we did. Sorry. Let me
extend this in so we can see side by
side. So, 40 * 1.2 is 48. And then we're
going to go with a 32
for our H3. So, this is our 32. And that
would be a 40. It's kind of nice when
the numbers work like this. Uh H4 is
going to be a 28. So I think we already
uh I don't think we did a 28 yet.
20 16 28 24 28s. No, I don't think we
did. I hope I didn't mess up anywhere in
here, but forgive me if I did. Uh 28 *
1.2.
So this is going to be our 32. There we
go. Oh yeah, I messed up here. I'm
trying to go quick, so forgive me. Our
H5 is our 24.
24 time 1.2. So these actually stay the
exact same. Our H5,
which is nice. Okay. And then let's go
with our H6. So 20. And then this also
stays the same. And then everything else
can stay the same. Now, a great rule of
thumb is all your paragraph sizes should
stay the exact same on mobile as they
are on desktop. You should not change
your paragraph sizes at all. Okay. So
there we have our desktop and also our
mobile. One thing too when it comes to
paragraph spacing, there's no like true
rule behind it. Okay, it's it's totally
up to you how you want to structure
these things. So like set this something
like4, you know, maybe for your
headings, you may maybe want it
something like 64 as paragraph spacing.
So maybe be 64
and this might be like 64. Maybe going
down, maybe you want to go with like a
48 and also like a 48. There's no like
true rule of thumb when it comes to
paragraph spacing, okay? You kind of
just got to like see how much spacing
you like to have between some of your
paragraph sizes. So maybe this one's 32.
Maybe this is 32. Um paragraph spacing
here. Maybe this is 20 and this is 20.
And maybe this is, you know, uh 20 and
also 20. So just do what you think looks
good for your brand at the end of the
day. Paragraph spacing. Maybe we'll set
this like 24 or 20. We'll just keep it
at 20 for now. I don't All right, we
might come back change it a little bit
later. 20 20 20 20 20
and then our 20 and then also uh our 20.
There we go. Okay. So then there we have
our responsive collection. But we're not
done just yet. Is there's still this
concept of like responsive variables or
what I call like jumper variables. We we
filmed a video on it last year and this
is also included in like our original
build a design system series, but it's
something I still want to cover uh
again. So, let's take a look at that
next. So, sorry I changed my mind. I
think it actually might make sense for
us to start to build out those jumper
variables once we actually get into um
like building out our components. It
might make a little bit more sense and
it's a really advanced topic. Like even
when I'm working with clients, it's
something they rarely like they really
struggle to understand is how your
jumper variables are supposed to work.
Um, so maybe we'll loop back to that a
little bit later on. But one thing, uh,
I might want to do here now, let's get
rid of those things here, is let's start
building out the actual text styles.
They're going to go into our components
here. Okay, this is going to be super
tedious. I know it's going to be
annoying, but it is what it is. Okay, so
let's start with our H1, our H2, uh, our
H3. Actually, we'll start with that for
now. I think I might have a little bit
of a hack here for us where we're going
to apply the variable for our H1 uh
which is going to be our 60 and our line
height. Line height is going to be uh
72. We can have par add paragraph
spacing here if we want to, but I'm just
not going to do that. And then this here
is going to be our headings. And then
this here is going to be um what do we
want to do here? Let's apply the
variable. Uh let's maybe go with our
font weight. Maybe we'll go with like a
semi-bold. Okay. So then we're gonna do
is we're going to go ahead create the
style of this. That's going to be our
H1. Really that simple. Uh at the end of
the day, um
actually maybe I'm just trying to think
here. Uh I think maybe what we can do is
to maybe sort of spruce things up a bit.
is
no. I think maybe we'll leave it like
this for now. Again, just cuz this is
like supposed to be like a simple video
cuz what you can also do is you can also
have like H1
semi-bold H1 bold, H1 medium, but I
think that might be a little bit too
complex for now. Uh so what we're going
to do then is let's detach this. Let's
set this to our H2. Uh and let's set
this to our H2 font size and our H2 uh
line height. Oops, sorry. I don't think
I did that right. H2 font size H2 uh
line height. And let's go ahead and
let's create the style of that. Let's
call that our H2.
Okay. Then let's detach this. Uh set
this to our H3 font size. H3 uh line
height. And let's create the style of
this that we're going to call H3.
And we'll call this H3. There we go.
Let's call this our H4. Let's detach.
Set this to our H4. Font size. Uh god,
sorry. I gotta keep remembering to like
actually select. Um this is going to be
our font size and our line height.
There we go. And let's call this our H4.
Uh let's then duplicate this. Detach.
Call this our
uh oops. Sorry, God. I'm all over the
place. This is going to be our H5 font
size. H5 line height. Uh, and let's call
this our H5.
But we need to call this our H5. There
we go. Now, let's call this our H6.
Select, detach.
There we go. Did it right this time. Uh,
our line height. There we go. And now,
here is our H6.
There we go. So, now that we have that
out of the way, uh, let's now look at
like our our paragraph. And again with
our paragraph, this can be really where
we like break things out into a bunch of
different styles, right? So what I mean
by that is uh let's see how we want to
handle things here. Um
you know what I think maybe for our body
is we might actually we'll we'll do
something a little bit more exciting. So
we might have like our small
um small link
small link
um and then also our small semi-bold
sorry small semib bold
semi bold for now we're going to look at
like our paragraph sizing. So with this
there should also be an extra small
actually. So what we're going to do here
sorry let me bring this all down. So
actually get rid of these and work our
way up this time. Okay. So, this here
we're going to apply our body.
And for this maybe just want to apply
like that that regular.
Okay. And what we're going to do here is
we're going to set our body
paragraph sorry paragraph sizing. Uh
where's our extra small font size
line height.
There we go.
Let's uh go ahead and create the sizing
of this. This is going to be our body uh
body
uh small.
Okay, let's duplicate this. Let's
detach. And what we can do here is we
can actually just add an underline if we
want to. And this is going to be our
body.
Sorry, this should be our body extra
small. Sorry about that. Thanks for
calling me out behind the scenes. X
small uh link. Okay. And let me just
rename this to X small.
And we can actually just duplicate this
uh and set this to our uh semi bold by
changing some of the items that are
actually in here. So this is probably an
easy easier way for us to do it
actually. But uh font weight semi-bold.
There we go. But it's kind of nice for
us to see how everything comes about. So
we have our extra small semi-bold and
then we have our uh extra small which is
sort of like our regular. That's one way
to approach it. So we have our small
uh link our let make sure to do this
right. Extra small link extra small
semibold and our extra small sort of
regular. Okay. So let's now group these
together. Let's um detach detach and
detach.
And for each of these what we can do is
just set this to um small 14 and also
that line height uh of that small.
So now what we can do, let's try to just
say x small. Sorry, I'm all over the
place here. Forgive me. It is late in
the day. Uh so what we can do now is
this will become our body uh small uh
link.
This is going to become our body small
body small
uh semibold. And this is going to become
our body small
body small. There we go. Uh, we're in
some good shape. So, let's select each
of these. Um, there we go. Let's
detach. Detach and then detach and
select all these. Select that next size
up, which is that font size medium and
that line height um of medium. There we
go. Let's call this our medium. Medium
and then medium. And let's go ahead and
start creating some of the styles here.
This is our body uh medium body medium
semibold.
There we go.
Body medium uh link. And then lastly,
sort of our large size. Okay. Let's make
sure we did this right. There we go.
Perfect. And this here is going to be
our large large and our large.
So let's just
sorry let's not do that. Let's detach
detach and let's detach.
So this here is going to be our our
large paragraph size font size large and
then our line height. Okay, perfect. So
now let's go ahead and create the style.
Come on. Body uh large link
uh body large
event
body large semi-bold. Let's just check
out the styles. Things look okay. If I
made any mistakes here, feel free to
call me out. Medium, medium, semi-bold,
medium link. They want to put the link
at actually at the
Let's try to think about how we want to
rearrange this. Put our extra smalls
first, then our semi-bold, then our
link. Our small semi-bold, then our
link, medium, semi-bold, then link. Uh
large, semi bold, and then link. Just a
way we can structure it a little bit.
Okay. And one thing we can also do is
just put these inside of a group as
well. Um that we're just going to call
our headings. So now we have the
variables applied inside of our actual
styles themselves. Okay. So again, if I
made any mistakes there, I apologize.
But now we have everything that we need
to actually start going ahead and
building out our components. Uh I'm
actually using the material icon
library. Okay, it has all these great
icons that just come in as local
components. Um so I'm just using
material for my icons, but you can
really use any icon library that you
would like. And I just put the icons
inside of my design system file. So
we're going to start with our button.
But one thing we might want to do is we
might just want to color scope uh our
variables. Okay. So basically what this
is doing is it's hiding certain
variables that like we might not
necessarily need. Right? So within
primary I'm not going to want any of
these. So I can choose to edit these
variables and I can choose to show these
or not when I'm actually applying
components. Okay. So now like these
variables here won't be shown um when
I'm applying certain components when I'm
applying the colors to components.
Sorry. And even with brand as well, what
we can do is just go into our all
variables here and just hide all the
ones that aren't necessarily going to be
used, which all of these really. Um,
yeah, even even the scale, too.
Actually, you know what? We'll leave the
scale in. Um, and I'll say why in just a
sec. So, we'll take out our purple.
These we're not going to need, and we'll
leave in our scale. Okay. So, let's edit
these variables. Just choose not to show
these. There we go. Um, and also too,
one thing we can do is we can go back
into alias. Um, let's go ahead. Let's
edit these variables.
What is this? This is a border width.
Uh, so one thing we can do is just
toggle this on and choose to only show
this uh in that stroke. Okay. So, you
can even we'll do the same with border
radius as well. It just helps us to
scope our colors pretty well. Um, so now
when I go and apply these variables, I
don't have to scroll through all the
variables that I had before. I can it's
just like let me show you what I mean
honestly. Um so let's go ahead and just
add in that radius. So now when I select
radius not how notice how border radius
is always there. Okay sure we have our
scale and the reason why I'm leaving in
the scale is because if you want to get
specific around applying variables for
padding and gap and things like that.
The scale is always nice to have. Um,
but yeah, not really recommended to to
not really mandatory, sorry, to have
your scale showing at all times. But
notice how with border radius now, I
don't need to scroll through all the all
the variables. It's right there. Okay,
perfect. Awesome. So, with that out of
the way, now we'll start with our
button. Okay, so with our button, what
we're going to do just put in something
like join UI collective, just some basic
text here. Okay, what I'm going to do is
I'm going to press shift A. Okay, and
that's going to add that auto layout
frame. One thing I want to make sure.
Okay, so perfect. This is set to our
body medium, which is that 16 size
frame. Okay, or 16 size text. Uh let's
go ahead and add in some variables now.
So, uh let's go ahead add in just a
surface
uh action. And we're going to set our
text to our text on action because again
our on action sort of say signifying
that it's on that background. There are
more complex ways to handle this. I've
covered it in the past, but that's what
we're rolling with for now. And we're
going to use our text on action probably
quite a lot. So, I'm actually just going
to go into our mapped, move our text on
action way up here. There we go. So,
let's also go ahead add in a stroke.
Now, often times what I see a lot of
designers do is even if their stroke is
the same color as their surface, they
just choose not to add a stroke, but it
kind of puts you in a box then because
if you do decide you need to add a
stroke, what you have to do is you have
to go back and add it to all your
components u a little bit later. So,
just even if it's the same, just add it.
Doesn't hurt anyone. Okay. So, let's
also go into our assets panel and let's
search for like our info icon.
There we go. So, we can pull that in
here. Um, we shrink this to like 20 by
20. There we go. And let's also set to
12. Sorry, our horizontal padding to 12
and 8. Keep things nice and snug. There
we go. Okay. Sorry. And let's set this
to our icon on action. And I'm going to
do the same uh for our icon actually as
well. Move our own action up. Okay. Um
so now our icon and our text are have
the exact same color. Okay. So let's go
ahead. Let's add in also a radius too.
Like maybe a radius of uh a radius of
two. Sorry. We're going to call this our
button. Let's go ahead maybe adjust the
gap something like eight. Let's create
the component of this. Uh and let's get
started from here. Okay. So before we go
ahead and add in our variants, let's go
ahead and add in some properties here.
So, if we look at this button, we're not
going to need an icon left and an icon
right at every time. We might just want
an icon left. We just might want an icon
right. We might not want an icon at all.
So, what we're going to do uh to start
is we're going to add a layer property
here that we're going to call uh icon
left. Okay. So, let me just copy that as
well. Um, and now what we want to do, so
if I bring this not this instance out.
Okay, now I can hide that icon left.
But I also want the option to swap that
icon because I'm not always going to
need an info icon. So with that, I'm
going to add an instance swap here in
the top right. Also call it icon left.
But what I like to do is add a little
emoji. And to do this, I did edit emo
emojis and symbols. I'm on a Mac. I know
there's a hotkey for it, but sorry, I'm
old school. And I like to add this sort
of downward downward arrow. Okay. So,
let's create that property. And now I
can sw easily swap out that icon for
another type of icon. You know, there's
just an example.
Perfect. So, we're also going to want to
do the same for icon right. So, let's
add in a layer property for icon rights.
So, icon right. There we go. Uh, let's
also create a instance swap for that
icon right. And again, we add the
downward facing arrow because we can't
have two properties with the same name.
It kind of shows like one is like nested
within the other using that arrow. Um,
you'll see what I mean here. Sort of
like icon left, icon left, right?
Anyways, I digress. Uh, and then lastly
is we're going to need a text property
for the label to easily change that. So,
let's just call that label. So, now we
can easily swap this out uh as well. So
there we have uh our initial button
component. Let's go ahead and also start
adding some variants. Now uh
uh so let's go ahead and let's start off
with our so this is going to be our
status. So this here is going to be our
default button and then this here is
going to be our hover button. So, let's
go with the surface action and then
surface action hover, our border action,
border action hover. And we're going to
keep our text uh icon on action and text
on action the same. You can have on
action properties for that. I have
tutorials in our academy where I go
through that level of complexity. Uh
we're going to leave it like that for
now and maybe only just change um our
just our surface and background. I just
getting started at this early stage.
Sometimes it can be a little bit
confusing if you do have um onaction
hovers. Okay, again we can introduce
that if we want to, but we're not going
to do that here just for simplicity
sake. Okay. Uh and this here is then
also going to be uh our hover. Um moving
along now is we're going to need a focus
element. Is what our focus element is
for is if you've ever actually used like
um like navigated a website via like
like a tab key. Okay. So, basically what
this does is allows those who are more
visually impaired to sort of see what's
selected if they're navigating a website
just via a tab key. Okay. It's what's
called a focus. You don't need to have
these in Figma, but I build them in
Figma just so my developers can see.
Okay. So, when it comes to my focus,
what I do is I set the width to two
pixels because I want it to be nice and
noticeable. Okay. And again, I just
copied my default because the default
and the focus should all as just as best
practice purposes should always have
roughly similar variables. Okay, I'm
going to set this to our border focus.
So, this is why we have that border
focus. And what I'm going to do is I'm
just going to simply copy and paste it
inside. And I know what you're saying,
Kirk, like that's not right. Like what?
Now, what I'm going to do actually is
actually bring this around
two pixels on either side.
Okay, let's set the radius of this to
four.
Radius of eight. Maybe let's actually go
radius of two.
Radius of two is fine. Maybe even radius
of four. I still think it looks a little
bit too square, but it's okay. Again,
we're not building the best looking
design system in the world. We're just
building a design system. Okay. So, now
we have that focus property all the way
around. But if I was to change this
label, learn more,
what do we notice is that the focus
doesn't adjust with it. And so what we
need to do is actually set our
constraints here with the focus selected
to left and right and top and bottom.
And now with those constraints set,
notice how whenever I adjust this to
maybe just something like hello, notice
how that focus property always like
follows with it. Okay,
beautiful. So there we have uh our
focus. Uh I just need to take a quick
drink of water, but then we're going to
look at our disabled and start looking
at some other variants as well. Okay, so
I'm back. Uh let's go ahead and let's uh
build our disabled now. So for our
disabled, we're just applying our
disabled properties. There's a bunch of
different ways that I've handled this in
the past as I'm sure you might you might
know, but really what we're doing just
applying our disabled. Um and again,
it's not the best looking disabled
button in the world. Um you know what?
just for my own sake. What we're going
to do is we're actually going to set our
uh surface disabled to something just a
little bit lighter.
There we go. And maybe even our border
disabled, too. Oops.
There we go. It just looks less harsh.
And maybe we actually might even want to
put our text disabled also a little bit
darker. Maybe just like that default
color.
And also our icons to match. Sorry, this
is me just getting picky now. I didn't
really didn't like the look of that
disabled. There we go. Okay, so there's
just uh a disabled button. Anyways,
let's continue on. Uh, perfect. So, with
that out of the way, let's go ahead and
let's add in another variant that we're
going to call type. And this here is
also going to be our default. Now, for
your type variants is where we can get a
little bit more like finicky with it.
This one is going to be uh our outline.
Okay. So, with our outline, what we're
going to do is we're just going to drop
the surface on each of these. But first,
let's set our icon on action to our uh
sorry, we're going to take this one at a
time, actually. So, let's drop the
surface. Um, keep the border on the
outside, but then our icon on action is
going to become our icon action, and our
text on action is going to become our
text action. Okay? And then uh let's
simply drop the surface again. Uh and
let's just set our icon on action to our
icon action hover and our text on action
to our text action hover. And now we're
going to do the same for our focus as we
did with our defaults. So drop um change
our icon to icons action and then our
text action. And I noticed a spelling
mistake here. Sorry. Icons, not icon.
There we go.
Um, and then for disabled, we're just
going to keep that the same just because
I like my disabled like relatively
similar in terms of consistency. Okay.
Um, perfect. And then lastly, one thing
we can also do as well, um, is sorry for
these, what I'm going to want to do is
actually just add in a fill for these.
Sorry, that's my mistake. That's just
going to be our surface default. Okay?
Because again, these are our these are
our outline, not our transparent.
Um, and then for these, what we're going
to do, because these are going to be uh
our full-on transparent,
our full-on transparent buttons, what
we're actually going to do is we're not
going to have any of that fill. And then
we're also going to remove the border
around the outside. Okay. Uh, so I hope
that makes sense. So here we have our
defaults full of color. Here we have our
outlines, which have that that white
background to it. And if I change the
page background here, hopefully you can
see what I mean. And then we have our
transpar our transparent here. Okay. Uh
which doesn't have any of that white
background. Okay. So, uh looks like we
have some conflicting variable names
here. So, let's see what's happening.
[Music]
So, this should still be also our type.
This should be our transparent. And that
should clear up any any duplicates.
Beautiful. So there we have it's a
simple button component, but it's a
great starting component for you to go
and and make tweaks. Again, not every
use case you might need. You might not
need you might not need a transparent,
you might not need an outline. Um, and
again, we go through more complex like
options of this on our academy where we
get into different sizing things like
subtle buttons and like things like
success and error, but this is a great
starting component for you. So now let's
work in our label component. And our
label component is going to go on top of
things like our field and other
components that would necessarily like
need a label. Now, we separate our label
component out because what it allows us
to do is create variants for the label
that we can actually swap out on an
input component to avoid like a ton of
other components for our input later on.
Anyways, you're going to see what I
mean. So, make sure this is set toward
body medium and then set this to our
text body. And let's go into our assets
panel and search for like a help icon.
Now, one thing we might do later is like
come back and swap this out on the label
for our actual tool tip component. But
anyways, we're going to continue with
this for now. Set that to our icon
action. Uh, and let's go ahead add some
auto layout. Let's make sure that uh our
properties here are set to hug and hug
for our label. And let's center align
left that label property as well. And
maybe we can set the gap to eight. And
we'll leave horizontal and vertical
padding both set to zero. Let's go
ahead, let's call this label. Let's go
ahead and create the component of this.
Now, if we think back to our button,
what's uh some properties that we might
need here. First off, label property or
text property for the label. So, we
easily swap that out. So, now I can
change this to something like uh first
name really easily with just a click.
And we're also going to want the option
to hide the icon, but are we going to
want the option to swap out the icon
if it's a label? But would you really
ever want an icon besides like the help
icon for some type of information?
Chances are probably not. So, we're
going to leave that as is for now. Okay.
But what's one thing that we noticed
here when we toggle on and off the icon?
It's like our frame shrinks a bit. And
it's because our icons out of the box
are pretty large at 24x4. So again, as
we go to the button, we'll shrink them
to 20 x 20. So now when we toggle these
on and off, there we have it. Okay,
perfect. So there's our label out of the
way. And one variant we're going to want
to add here is this here is going to be
it's going to be just our type.
This here is going to be our defaults.
And this one here is actually going to
be our required. So what we're going to
do with require is we're actually going
to add a small asterisk. Okay,
small asterisk. Set that to our text
error or sorry our icon error. Excuse
me. Best to stay consistent. icon air on
the inside.
Okay. But what we're going to do is if
we think about a label, all of a sudden,
if we were to like sw the component,
say you have like two form fields
stacked on top of each other, all of a
sudden the asterisk is going to push the
label further to the right and it's
going to look a little bit wonky. So,
what we're actually going to do is if I
add back in uh actually probably don't
need a guide there, so I don't know why
I did that. Is we're actually going to
absolute position this. Okay, just
simply to the left just like that. So,
the asterisk is actually going to come
in front of the label and it's not going
to be inside the frame itself, but it's
just absolute positioned outside. Okay,
so that's going to allow us to keep all
the labels in line with one another.
Now, a question I get all the time is,
"Kirk, can't the asterisk just go at the
end?" But for accessibility purposes,
what you're going to want to have happen
is for a user to see the field is
required and then see the field name.
Okay? Just best practice from
accessibility. Okay. So, there we have
uh our required. Beautiful. So, with our
label out of the way, let's look at our
input and then also our field. So, we're
actually going to start off with our
field uh and then our input. Now for our
field here, let's go ahead uh and just
uh so let's set this something like
placeholder. Just add some text and set
this to our text body. Okay. Um
and then what we're going to do is just
add in two icons. So again, maybe we can
add in this help outline icon and then
maybe also person or profile
uh profile icon or user. or should see
it comes back with user
or we'll go with a smiley face. It
doesn't really matter for now because we
can swap it out either way. Okay, what
we are going to do here is we are going
to select each of these, add some auto
layout. Okay, let's make sure that this
is set to hug and hug to start and set
the app to just like something like 12
or eight. So, it's very similar to our
button. Let's go ahead. Let's add in
some padding here. So, like 12 and then
also uh eight. And uh let's add in a
quick stroke just so you can start to
visualize some things. Okay, so it's
going to be our border default. And
let's add in our surface,
which is going to be our surface
default. Now, if you think about like an
input field, okay, you know, it might
have a placeholder that's like first
name. It might have a placeholder that's
like name or email.
What's awkward about this is that the
the these icons are not in line. Okay.
So, very similar to what we just looked
at with the label. It's best to keep
like related elements in line with each
other. So, what we're going to do is
actually just always set this to fill.
So, it's always going to push um this
icon at the right to the right. Simple,
right? So, let's call this field. And uh
let's also add in a radius here of
something like 2 pixels. And sorry, I
should also set a border width. Use my
variables. Set that to one. And there we
go. things are looking in some pretty
good shape. And also for consistency
purposes, I don't like the 24x 24. I
want it 20 x 20 just to keep things nice
and snug. Okay, so let's go ahead and
let's create the component of this. And
now let's add in some properties here.
So now this is looking a little bit more
like a field. So start off with our
icon. Let's go ahead. Let's add an icon
uh left. There we go. And also add an
instant swap for that icon left.
Of course, add that downward facing
arrow where I put edit emojis and
symbols. Add the downward facing arrow.
There we go. Icon left. Create the
property. Let's do the same. And again,
make sure you're doing this on the main
component because you can't do it on the
instance of the component. Uh so let's
add for our icon right.
There we go. And then add in uh a
property for that icon right.
There we go. So now we have our icon
left, icon left, icon right, icon right,
too. Oops, something went astray here.
So sorry about that. Forgive me. So this
should actually be our icon right.
Sorry. And let's make sure we rearrange
these. So this is no longer not used in
the component. Sorry, I was going to
start from scratch here. So we have our
icon, right? And now let's add in our
instance swap for that icon, right?
Sorry, my mistake. Silly mistakes. It's
the morning here. Need more coffee.
There we go. Perfect. So now that should
work as intended. Perfect. Now, of
course, we're also going to want uh a
text property for the first name or not,
not for the first name, sorry, for the
label. There we go. So, now on our
instance, okay, we have our icon left,
icon left, icon right, uh icon right,
and then also our label. Perfect. So,
with that out of the way, let's go ahead
and add in some variants. So, let's go
ahead. Let's add in uh our first hover
effects. Um
actually, because these are kind of
long, maybe we'll just go downwards this
time. Okay. So, let's go with our first
off. This is going to be our status. Uh
so, this is going to be our defaults.
And then this here is going to be our
hover. So, when it comes to our hover,
what I like to do is just set our border
default to our border action hover. You
can also change the icons if you want.
But um when it comes to the surface,
what's kind of nice is maybe even have
like an action hover two. Okay, so
action hover. It can even be like action
hover two or action hover lights. Okay,
so with that, let's just set it like a
50. And then this one, of course, like
the darker one for dark mode.
So what we can do now is we can get like
a surface action hover light. Sort of
adds sort of like a makes it stand out a
little bit more that something's being
hovered. Okay, you can play around with
it. I know it doesn't look great as it
stands right now. Uh, but you can also
set it to like a certain like your icon
on action or like a darker version of
that. Um, so it's not just so it's not
so harsh if you know what I mean. So
like even like an icon action hover,
like a text action hover, that's the you
have that option to do that too. And I
don't think that looks half bad at the
end of the day. Okay, so there's our
hover effect. Um, and again, you can
also go ahead. Yeah. Yeah, enough of
that. uh is go ahead and add like a
while hovering. You know, you're going
to change it to to hover. Okay. Um let's
also go ahead and let's add in also our
focus. So, this is going to be very
similar to what we did with our button.
It's just two pixels all the way around.
Add a stroke
border width uh of two pixels. Uh drop
the fill. Uh set this to our border
focus. Okay, there we go. Copy. And then
paste it all the way around. Again, use
your absolute positioning tool.
There we go.
One, two,
one, two,
one, two.
Then we have our one, two. So, we can
set those constraints again, remember,
to left and right and also on top and
bottom. And we're set the radius to
something like four. Okay, so there we
have our focus. And then lastly, let's
do our disabled.
So when it comes to our disabled, uh
let's go with a surface disabled, border
disabled, uh icon disabled, and then our
text uh disabled.
There we go. And then there is our
disabled field. Okay. So there I think
we're in some pretty good shape uh for
our field. So one thing um I also
covered in our legacy series is the idea
of like a state. Okay. Uh so whether
it's filled or not filled. So that this
here is going to be not filled. This
here these ones here can be if this is
filled. Basically what this is saying is
that sometimes what you might want to
have here is if we go into our variables
and into our text you might want to have
like a body placeholder. Okay. And with
that you tend to get a little bit of
like a lighter shade. It's maybe like a
400
where on your not filled maybe these are
a little bit lighter. Okay, so these are
your text placeholder. So some things
like filled versus not filled like
you've enter text versus not entered
text. Okay, um it's a little bit more of
an advanced topic. Um and there's a lot
of other things that you can do with
that. But that's just touching it at uh
a nutshell for now. The state not filled
or if that or if that field is actually
filled itself. So now we're going to do
is we're going to work on our input.
Okay. So with your input, what you're
doing is just taking your like your
label property. Okay, just a copy of it
and then also a copy of like one of your
fields and uh just pasting it uh below.
And we're sort of piecing the two uh
together. So maybe for this we want to
hide both the icons just to keep it nice
and clean. Okay, let's group these in
auto layout. Set that to something like
eight. Okay. And let's go ahead and
let's uh create the component of this
and call this uh art input. Now, one
thing you might want to do as well is
also just add in uh like placeholder
text here. Placeholder
uh text.
You can also create the component of
this placeholder text if you would like
to. Okay? But I'm not going to do that
for now. Um, you can do that if you'd
like to, if you want like more control
over your placeholder text. Uh, we're
just going to set this to to hug and
also to hug or sorry, fill and hug
vertically. This to our, uh, text body.
There we go. And uh, let's go ahead and
just add in some nested instances to
start. So, what nested instances are is
if we look at uh, our field component
here, if I was to click on this field
component, notice how I have access to
all these properties. But if I click on
our input component, notice how all of
those properties are now gone. Okay. So,
we're going to want the option here to
toggle on all the great properties that
we had before. So, to do that, we just
hit um I'll do that again slowly. So,
properties, nested instances, then
toggle on label and field. So, now when
I hit this, notice how I have all
retained all the properties from our
components inside of these components,
right? But what's something else is that
we might not always want this
placeholder text. So, let's go ahead and
add in a lab layer property for uh
placeholder text
or uh what's the word I'm looking for?
Explainer text. Explainer text. Probably
a better term for it. Explainer text or
hint text. Sorry, that's the word that
I'm going to use. Uh sorry to throw you
for a loop there. So, this here is going
to be our hint hint text.
There we go. And now I can also toggle
on and off that hint copy if I'd like
to. And of course, one thing we're also
going to want is a layer proper is a
text property, sorry, for that hint
text. And again, just because we can't
have two properties with the exact same
name, what we're going to do is add in
that downward facing arrow here.
There we go. So hopefully that shows how
you can like piece use components that
we built in order to combine them
together to build other components. Now,
that concept's actually called like
atomic design. Uh, it's a guy named Brad
Frost, who's also a design system
expert, who like came up with that
concept. Uh, I'm going to cover that
topic a little bit more in depth in a
future video. So, be sure to like
subscribe for that. But now we have this
completed input component. So, again, we
added hit hit text. Um, we added our
label component, our field component,
combined those together, and we added
our nested instances here as well. So,
now we can toggle everything on and off.
And hopefully this also shows you like
why it's a pretty good idea to have a
label
um as a separate component and not just
include it in an input as I see a lot of
people do because now we have like a lot
of control over that label whether it's
defaults or whether it's required. Okay,
we don't need necessarily different
variants for our input field. Now one
thing we might want to do is just hide
this hint text by defaults. And you can
also get creative with this. Okay, like
uh if you do have certain inputs, this
can just sort of be um you know your
type and maybe this is your like your
defaults. But you can also get into
specific use cases. Okay, so this here
might be email. Uh and with your email,
maybe like that button is actually
hidden or that icon is actually hidden.
And then you have an icon left with u
oops with something like a mail.
There we go. So you can use that to sort
of set all like these different, you
know, variants for different fields that
you might need for your components. And
you can set this to something like
email. And then there you go. And of
course, you can always toggle on and off
these different icons and all the
different properties still. Okay. So
I'll leave that to you to get creative
around what kind of like properties you
want for your input component or what
variants, sorry, you want for your input
component. But here's a great starting
point. So now let's go ahead and let's
uh build out our menu component. And so
it's going to look pretty similar the
setup at least to a lot of like the
other items. So it's going to be like uh
our other components we might have built
so far. So it's going to be our menu
item. Let's go ahead and add in just
maybe like um I don't know like a
settings like a gear.
No, it's not there. Okay, we're going to
add a person. Um and then also like a I
don't know like a arrow.
Whatever. It doesn't really matter what
icons we use. So, let's go ahead add in
some auto layout. And something got all
messed up there. Okay. So, let's just
ignore that. Let's ungroup that. And
then let's go ahead and do this again.
So, let's add some auto layout. And then
we're going to set this to something
like 12 uh as a gap. Again, make sure
that this is set uh to hug and left
center align. Okay. So, we're going to
build our menu item. And the menu items
are going to be com are going to be
combined into like one menu component,
if that makes sense. So, very similar to
what we looked at with our placeholder
is like we're always going to want or
not our placeholder, sorry, our field is
we're always going to want the icon
right to always be at the end. So, we
can set that to fill and make sure it's
set to our text uh body.
There we go. And we're going to set this
to something like 12 and then also
something like eight vertically. Let's
add in a quick fill, which is going to
be our surface uh defaults. We're not
going to add in a radius. Uh let's also
add in a stroke maybe just on the
bottom. And a border uh defaults. Uh and
again just on the bottom. So always be
sure to set that as one pixel. And then
just on the bottom. And you're going to
see why we set that just on the bottom
as well. So let's call it is this our
dot menu item. Okay. And we set this as
like a dot menu item because when we
publish this component ideally like it
won't get published. Um, and adding that
that period in front of it sort of
signifies to Figma that hey, we don't
want to publish this. Okay. So, let's
then go ahead and uh so there's our
initial menu item, but again, we're
going to need to add in some properties
here. So, starting off with our icon uh
left,
icon left. There we go. Create the
property.
And then also an icon left as well. Add
in that downward facing arrow.
Sorry, I know you can't probably see
this part, but icon left. Create the
property and then also an icon right.
Oh, sorry. I need to do on the main
component. Oops. There we go. Icon
right.
Icon right.
And drop the arrow that I copied in.
There we go. Because we got to add that
on the instance swap. And then uh create
the property again. icon, right, for the
instant swap. Beautiful. So, things are
looking good. And of course, we're going
to need a text property uh for that
label. Okay, there we go. Just like
that. Now, so there is our initial uh
menu item, but let's go ahead and add in
some variants here. Okay, so let's go
ahead and let's uh start creating some
variants here. So, of course, we're
going to need a hover. And this here is
going to be our status.
And this here is going to be our
default.
So for this, what we have is our set
this to our border uh action and our
surface is going to be our surface uh
action hover lights. And maybe we just
want to keep like those like the same
colors and the same the same colors.
Actually, you know what? What the heck?
Let's set it to our icon action hover
and our text action hover as well, just
for consistency purposes. And also,
we're going to need it disabled. Okay.
So, with our disabled, what we're going
to do again, you guessed it, surface
disabled, border uh disabled, icon
disabled, text uh disabled,
and there we have it. Okay. So, now that
we have that out of the way is you could
introduce like another variant which is
going to be called like our like like a
it can be a state, it can be a type,
doesn't really matter. Um, and our first
is going to be unselected cuz you think
about a menu, you might always have one
option that's selected and one option
and and one option that's selected and
all the others are not selected, right?
So then these here are going to be our
selected variants.
So with our selected variants, again,
this is going to be our surface uh
action. Again, sort of signify that it's
selected. This is our going to be our
border action and then our icon uh on
action and then our text on action. So
that's as if like that menu item
specifically is selected. Okay. And now
it's going to be our surface action
hover and our border action hover. And
then this is going to become our uh icon
on action and then our text on action.
And then there's also uh like our
disabled just going to stay the same.
Okay. And when I check there's no
overlaps in componentry. So, I think
we're off to a pretty good start. Okay.
So, now what we're going to do uh is
let's start piecing together uh the menu
component. Now, let's piece together a
menu component. So, I'm going to take
our menu item here.
And something strange just happened
where you can see it all of a sudden it
added a border on all sides. When on our
component here, we only have a border on
the bottom.
I haven't seen that one before.
And it did it again. So, I think we're
witnessing a Figma bug in real time
here. So, we're just going to proceed.
One thing I had done is I just increased
the size of our padding like
horizontally just to give ourselves some
more room. And I just hid the icon left
in the layers here. So, it's still
there. I just hid it. So, let's go ahead
and just add in a bunch. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
and then eight. And maybe we can just go
ahead and just hide a couple. Okay. And
it'll just set one to to selected. Okay.
So, let's call this uh our menu. And now
one thing you might want to do as well,
and I think just the fact that it might
get a little weird with the fact that we
have borders on all sides now with our
menu item, but anyways, um, what you
should realistically do is add in a
stroke. Okay, so this would be like a
border
defaults. And one thing you can do is
add in a quick scroll bar. So how to do
that is I just add in this scroll bar
looking thing. Set it to like your
border default. Set the radius to
something like round
and um add an auto layout frame. Call
this your scroll bar. Uh create the you
can create the component if you want to
have that level of control. We're not
going to do it here. But then inside
your menu items is you're actually going
to add them inside of a frame. Okay? So
shift A to add them inside of a frame.
And then inside the parent menu, you're
going to paste that in. So now you can
see we sort of have two frames here. one
with the menu items and then one with
just the scroll bar and then using
um what's the word I'm looking for? Uh
auto layout, you can just set it from
set it side to side. Okay. And we can
even just set this to something like
eight and then eight just to achieve the
look that you're going for. Um so then
set this to uh fill. So this is just
sort of showing here that like um you if
there's a menu that's scrollable
multiple options, you can do that too.
And then maybe we can set the radius
here to two. And it looks it might look
a little weird just because we shouldn't
have like the the border on the right.
Um but anyways, and sorry, I should
probably set the apply a variable for
our border width. Let's create uh the
component of this. And you can also just
toggle on have an option to show scroll
bar or not. Oops. By adding in a layer
property for scroll bar. There we go. So
we can turn that on and off. But we
still lost all our great properties that
we set with our menu items. So let's go
into our properties and our nested
instances and just simply toggle all of
those on.
There we go. So now I can see on our
menu we have all those great components
uh upgrade properties and perfect there
is our menu item with a live Figma bug.
So now let's piece together a menu
component. So, I'm going to take our
menu item here, and something strange
just happened where you can see it all
of a sudden it added a border on all
sides. Went on our component here. We
only have a border on the bottom.
I haven't seen that one before.
And it did it again. So, I think we're
witnessing a Figma bug in real time
here. So, we're just going to proceed.
One thing I had done is I just increased
the size of our padding like
horizontally just to give ourselves some
more room. And I just hid the icon left
in the layers here. So it's still there.
I just hid it. So let's go ahead and
just add in a bunch. One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, and then eight.
And maybe we can just go ahead and just
hide a couple. Okay. And we'll just set
one to to selected. Okay. So let's call
this uh our menu. And now one thing you
might want to do as well, and I think
just the fact that it might get a little
weird with the fact that we have borders
on all sides now with our menu item, but
anyways, um, what you should
realistically do is add in a stroke.
Okay, so this would be like our border
defaults. And one thing you can do is
add in this quick scroll bar. So how to
do that is I just add in this scroll bar
looking thing. Set it to like your
border default. Set the radius to
something like round
and um add an auto layout frame. Call
this your scroll bar. Uh create the you
can create the component if you want to
have that level of control. We're not
going to do it here. But then inside
your menu items is you're actually going
to add them inside of a frame. Okay? So
shift A to add them inside of a frame.
And then inside the parent menu, you're
going to paste that in. So now you can
see we sort of have two frames here. one
with the menu items and then one with
just the scroll bar. And then using
um what's the word I'm looking for? Uh
auto layout, you can just set it from
set it side to side. Okay. And we can
even just set this to something like
eight and then eight just to achieve the
look that you're going for. Um so then
set this to uh fill. So this is just
sort of showing here that like um you if
there's a menu that's scrollable,
multiple options, you can do that too.
And then maybe we can set the radius
here to two. And it looks it might look
a little weird just because we shouldn't
have like the the border on the right.
Um but anyways, and sorry, I should
probably set the apply a variable for
our border width. Let's create uh the
component of this. And you can also just
toggle on have an option to show scroll
bar or not. Oops. By adding in a layer
property for scroll bar. There we go. So
we can turn that on and off. But we
still lost all our great properties that
we set with our menu items. So let's go
into our properties and our nested
instances and just simply toggle all of
those on.
There we go. So now I can see on our
menu we have all those great components.
Uh upgrade properties and perfect. There
is our menu item with a live Figma bug.
Okay. So let's go ahead and let's bring
in uh just a check icon for our checkbox
to start. And you know what we like to
do? We like to set this by 20 to 20. And
let's go ahead and just add some auto
layout around it. Uh there we go. Maybe
set this to something like eight. Uh and
then also like eight. Okay. So let's
call this our checkbox. And what we're
going to do is we're going to add in a
surface action. And also a stroke, which
is our border
action. Uh and we're actually going to
set it on the outside. And also this
time to uh just one pixel for now. I
always like to have my checkbox the
border go on the outside just to make it
a little bit like bigger. Um, but as
again that's just personal preference.
You don't need to do it if you don't
want to. And we're set that radius to
four and set our icon default to our
icon on action. Okay, so things are
looking pretty good for our checkbox.
And again, you can play around with this
if you want to. If you think the check
is a little bit proportionately small,
you can set that to four and four if
you'd like. But I like my checkbox is
just a little bit big. Um, so here it's
36x 36 and we're going to roll with that
uh for now. Okay, so let's go ahead.
Let's create the component of this. And
now let's go ahead. Let's add in some
variance here. So we're actually going
to go horizontal this time.
So for this here is going to be our
status to start.
This here is going to be uh so we have
our default our default and then we're
going to have here our hover. So for our
hover, we're going to go with our
surface action hover and then our border
action hover. And our icon on actions is
going to stay the same. And we're also
going to need a focus. Okay. So this is
going to be pretty similar to what we
did a little bit earlier on. We're going
to add in uh that stroke. Add in a fill.
Set this to our border focus radius,
which is going to be our border width,
excuse me, 2 pixels on the outside. So
just going to place this all the way
around. And again, you're going to want
to use your absolute positioning tool or
ignore auto layout
to just place that two pixels all the
way around.
There we go. Set those constraints to
left and right and top and bottom. And
set that radius to something like eight.
There we go. So, let's see. 2 pixels. 2
pixels. 2 pixels. 2 pixels. There we go.
And then there we have our focus. And
then lastly, we're going to need to work
with our disabled.
We're going to go with the surface
disabled,
border disabled, and then our icon uh
disabled. Okay, so there we have uh our
disabled uh icon. Okay, or our disabled
checkbox. And then these are ultimately
going to become our selected checkboxes.
Okay, so now let's move on to our
unselected checkboxes and then also add
in the label uh to this checkbox. So,
one thing before I actually get into
this selected versus unselected that you
can also do if you really want to is if
something's in an error state. Um, so
you can get set this to status air where
you set this to your surface uh air
border error and then also like your
icon uh air. You have that option to do
that uh as well if you'd like to. Um,
and you can sort of get, you know,
funky. And we go into in our academy
courses, we go a little bit more in
depth into like things like how to build
this out properly, like all the
different types for errors and stuff,
but anyways, we'll leave that as just an
option for now. Um, and what we're going
to do now is let's go ahead and let's
add in a new variant here that we're
going to call type.
And these first ones here are going to
be selected.
And these here are going to be our
unselected.
There we go. Selected and unselected.
Now, for each of these, what we're going
to do is just simply get rid of that
icon al together. Okay. And now we can
make some adjustments. So, because our
default and our focus share the same
colors, we can set this to uh our
surface defaults. And we can keep the
border action the way it is. Then our
surface action can become our surface
action hover light. And the border can
stay the same. And then our def
disableds can also just stay as they
were. Okay. So there we have our
selected versus unselected. Now, one
thing we're going to want to do here is
um you can also add in like some hover
effects here if you want to. So like on
hover while hovering,
you know, you swap to this variance and
then on click you swap to this variant
and then while hovering you swap to this
and then on click, you know, you you
swap to you swap to this one. it's an
option for you to sort of set up some of
that prototyping. But we're going to
also want to introduce like a label for
this. Okay, so this is going to be our
checkbox label. So let's go ahead. Let's
uh oops, sorry, not add some auto
layout. Let's select both these elements
and add some auto layout here and then
set uh our constraints on this to hug
and hug and center left align and set
this to something like 12. Okay, so this
is going to be our checkbox uh label.
So, you're going to have a checkbox
component or a checkbox label. If you
wanted to, you can uh set this to
checkbox. And what that's going to do is
just stop that from publishing. So, when
we publish the design system at the end,
you likely shouldn't see those. And just
call this checkbox if you want to. Um,
we'll just go with that for now. So,
let's go ahead. Let's create the
component of this. And a couple things
that we're going to need to do. first
off is we're going to want uh to
have the option to hide this label if we
want to. It's more of an edge case more
than anything else, but we're going to
offer the option to hide label. Okay.
And then also an option to uh change
that label nice and easily. Okay. So,
add in a text property, but because we
already have a property named label,
we're just going to add a downward
facing arrow here.
There we go. So now we have the option
to hide that label. But we we now lost
all the great properties that we built
with our checkbox here. So what we need
to do is go into our nested instances
and expose those properties. So now when
I hit our instance here, I see I can
hide our label and I can also toggle
between all the great checkbox
properties uh or statuses and types that
that we built a little bit earlier.
Okay, beautiful. There's our checkbox.
Okay, so now let's go ahead and look at
our radio button. So with our radio
button here, uh we're just going to add
an ellipse to the canvas. We're going to
set that to 8 by 8, but the size it's
totally up to you. And I'm going to set
this to like a darker background so you
can see what I'm rocking with because
we're going to set this to a surface
default. Then on top of this ellipse is
I'm going to add an auto layout frame.
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to
press shift A here. Okay. And what
that's going to do, it's going to add
the auto layout frame on top of that
where I'm going to set the fill to our
surface action. See how it's already
starting to come together? And maybe we
can set this to something like just like
an 8 by 8 as well. Keep things nice and
snug. Now, this looks does not look like
a radio button. This just looks like a
square. So, if we add in our radius
here, what's the one thing that we
notice is that we don't necessarily have
like a radius for like that nice round
radio button. So, what we can go ahead
and do is just go in and add that uh to
our radius where we're just going to
have like a round where we can just sort
of set it to the largest value in our
scale, whatever that is. Okay.
So, now when we go ahead and add in that
uh radius, set that to round. Now, you
can see it's nice and round. But we're
also going to need a stroke here as
well, which is going to be our border uh
action. You can set it to the inside, to
the outside, it doesn't really matter.
It's up to you and your brand. And very
similar to what we looked at with
checkbox, we can maybe call this our
radio button to stop it from being like
published if we want to. Uh but anyways,
let's uh proceed with that for now. And
now let's go ahead. Let's create the
component. So with that out of the way,
let's change our background back to
white here. And let's go ahead and let's
add in a variant now. So again, very
very similar to what we looked at with
our checkbox is we can call this our
status. This here is our defaults. This
here will be our hover.
So with our hover, surface action hover,
border action hover, and the inside
element can stay the same. And then with
our focus is, I'm sure you guessed it by
now, what we need to do is add in uh an
ellipse all the way around, border width
of 2 pixels, set that to our border
focus, and then copy and then paste it
around. And again, use your absolute
positioning tool just to just to get it
two pixels as best you can. It's tough
with a circle, honestly, but I think
that's not so bad. And now, even though
like this is always going to be a
circle, so we would technically wouldn't
need to set our constraints with the
focus. Always best practice, set those
constraints left and right, top and
bottom. Okay, so there we have our
focus. And then lastly, we have our uh
disabled. So with our disabled, we can
go surface disabled. Uh border disabled.
There we go. And maybe we want to set
this to uh our surface disabled, but
that might be a little bit too light.
Sorry. Yeah, I'm not a fan of that. So
maybe we want to set this to actually to
our icon disabled. Beautiful. So now
let's bring these down. Um, and what
we're going to do is, uh, add another
type here, cuz we're going to have our
selected and our unselected. So, these
are all going to be our selected,
and then these here are all going to be
our unselected.
So, with our unselected, what we're
going to do is simply just get rid of
that ellipse uh, on the inside of each
of these, and we're just going to swap
that fill to a surface default.
our surface action hover light, our
surface defaults, and then our disabled
can stay the same. Okay, so there we
have our initial um radio button
variance, but we're also going to need
is that label. Okay, so very similar to
what we looked at with the checkbox um
you know, radio button label.
So if we go back to our checkbox
component, you can see here, oops,
noticed a bug here while I was at it.
So, this should also be set to our text
body. So, forgive me there. So, this
should set to our text uh body.
There we go. So, let's select both of
these, add auto layout, and set the gap
of that to eight. Okay. So, let's set
this to hug and also to hug. And let's
go ahead and call this our radio button.
Let's go ahead. Let's create the
component of this now. And let's again
let's add in some of the properties here
that we did before. So starting off with
our this should be set to our text body.
Text body.
Perfect. So what we're going to do is
let's uh start off with a layer property
for that label just in case we want to
hide it. And then also add in that text
property for the label as well. So to do
this I'm adding edit uh emojis and
symbols and then uh arrow.
Beautiful. There we go. So, let's create
the property for that. So, now on an
instance here, we can turn that on and
off. Also, too, is we're going to want
to also add in our nested instance. So,
we toggle on that radio button. So, now
on our our instance, we have all those
great properties that we just built from
our radio button component. And there
you go. There's our radio button. Okay.
So, next what we're going to do is we're
going to add uh build our switch. So,
this is like our switch or like our
toggle. So, when it comes to your
switch, like depending on how large you
want to make it, okay, this ellipse is
going to like influence a whole lot of
things. So, kind of similar to our radio
button in that sense. So, just like a
radio button. Okay, so we're adding that
ellipse. And again, one thing you might
want to do, and sorry, I know like my
face is probably covering covering on
the recording, is just name like the
frame like the sorry, the ellipse like
knob. Um, and again, as we're going
through this, use Figma's AI to like
rename all your layers. So, I hate
renaming layers. Anyways, um okay. So,
now let's make some adjustments here
because if we visualize what the switch
is going to look like, we're going to
start with our switch on. So, if that
switch is toggled on, so we're going to
align it at the right. Okay. So, let's
maybe just set uh our background here to
a different color and then also add a
fill. So, this is where the size of the
knob can help influence like how large
you want your switch to be. There's no
like best practice here by any means. So
like build a switch, insert it into your
UI, play around with like how it kind of
looks and how it feels. But one thing I
might want to do is maybe just make it a
little bit more condensed. Even maybe
set this to something like a four. Maybe
you want it small, nice and tight. And
then set our horizontal to something
like an eight. Let's let's play around
with that. Let's now go ahead and add a
radius at the full frame to something
like round. Okay. And I think that's a
little bit too long. So maybe if you
want to set this to something like a 64
width, you have that option to do so.
Okay. But what's something that we
noticed here? This is almost like
there's too much space here to this
right hand side. So maybe if we oops,
sorry. If we maybe set it to something
like a six, that's even better. Or even
like a four. I think that's looks a
little bit more snug with me so far.
Beautiful. Okay. So now let's work on
actually applying the color. So if this
is our switch on to start, you know,
it's like an action that's toggled on.
So similar to our radio button and our
checkbox, that switch off would be like
a little bit more like white. Okay. So,
and then also that text or that knob.
We're just going to set this to our
surface default. Beautiful. Now our
switch is really coming to life. We're
also going to add a stroke, which is
going to be our border action. And I
think we're in some pretty good shape
here. Uh, one thing too, of course,
always add the border width uh to one
pixel. And again, if I forgot to do that
on any other components, just go back
and make that adjustment. So, now that
we have our switch here, let's go ahead
and set our background. And let's just
call this switch uh item. And again, if
you don't want to publish your switch,
add the period before you create the
component of that. Beautiful. So, let's
create uh the component uh of that. I
don't know why that won't close. Okay.
So, now let's go ahead and let's add in
a variant. So, with our variant, so our
first one, this is of course going to be
our status. And then this here going to
be our default. And again I rename it so
that the it starts with like a
lowercase. I always have the name of the
variant start with an uppercase as you
can see here like status um and then the
name of the variant itself like um
always lowerase. Okay. And now let's do
our hover. So this here is going to be
our hover. I'm sure you guessed it. So
we're going to have our action hover and
our border action hover. And we can keep
our surface default as is. And there's
our hover. Now, we also need to do our
focus. So, if you watched all the other
parts of this video by now, I'm sure you
know exactly what we're going to do for
our focus. Uh, drop the fill, add a
stroke, um, and use our absolute
positioning tool. Uh, I know they
renamed it to like ignore auto layout,
but, you know, I'm a Figma OG, so I
still like my absolute positioning tool.
And we're going to set this to our
border focus uh, on the outside and two
pixels. There we go. Um, again, two
pixels because we want our focus state
to be like nice and visible.
Two pixels,
two pixels, and two pixels. And of
course, it looks a little weird as a
box. Uh, but if we set that around now,
it looks a little more clear. And make
sure you can rename like the rectangle
to focus in the layers. Sorry, I know my
face is covering that. And then set your
constraints to left and right and also
top and bottom. Okay, so there we've got
a decent looking switch. And then
lastly, we got to work on our disabled
as well. Okay, so with our uh disabled,
so we're going to start off with our
surface disabled, our border disabled.
And then same with the knob, similar to
what we did with the radio button is we
don't want to put a surface disabled,
but we can apply our icon disabled.
Okay? And that's going to signify uh
that that's on. Beautiful. So there we
have uh all of our appropriate um items
here. So now what if you know this is if
this switch is on but what about if it's
off right? So with that let's add
another variant here which is going to
be type and
this can be like selected unselected as
we have like checkbox radio button. And
it could also be on and off because
something could be a switch that is
selected but there could also be on
maybe just to keep things consistent
maybe this is selected. Okay, but like
the the naming convention here it's up
to you in like your own design system.
So and then these here are unselected.
Unselected. Okay. So where each of these
we just need to reposition the knob.
Okay. So to do that I just really
selected all of them and again just
using our auto layout here just align
that left. So let's make some
adjustments now. So, our surface action
is going to become our surface defaults.
And our border action is going to become
our border defaults. And let's think
about how we want to do the knob here.
So, I select both of these knobs. I
think maybe we can maybe do like a
border action. It doesn't look half bad,
but I think maybe the purple could be a
little bit weird. You might want to
explore with maybe some different
treatments here. I think if we were to
do like our our icon disabled, I just
think it looks a little bit too much
like a disabled or sorry, our icon.
Yeah, our icon disabled. I think it
looks a little bit too disabled. So, I
think maybe we can just leave that at
the action. I think that's fine.
Okay. So, then we're going to add our
surface action hover lights. And again,
maybe our this becomes our knob here
will become our uh action hover. And
let's make sure our border is our action
hover, which it is already. Perfect. And
there we go. I think we're in some
pretty good shape. So we have make sure
there's no variant overlaps. So just to
summarize here, we can switch between
all the different items for hover, for
focus, for disabled, and also for
selected or unselected. Now, very
similar to our checkbox is, of course,
we're also going to need like that
label. Okay. And the radio button. So
radio. Let's add in the label. Label
radio button label here.
Sorry, there's some someone honking
outside. You might hear that. Uh, and
let's set that to our text body. And
then select both, add some auto layout.
So, let's see what we did here. So, we
set the gap to eight. And let's try to
be consistent. Set that gap to eight as
well. Make sure that this is set uh to
hug and hug. And uh I think we're in
some pretty good shape. So, let's go
ahead and let's call this our radio
button.
And let's create the component of this.
Okay. So, now that we have the component
created, let's go ahead and of course,
I'm sure you guessed it by now, add a
layer property for the label, just in
case, and there's an ever a use case
where you do want that label hidden and
then also a text property for that label
as well.
So, to get that edit emojis and symbols,
use that downward facing arrow.
There we go. Because we can't have two
properties with the same name. So when I
bring down uh an instance here again I
can turn on and off that label. But
again we still need to add our nested
instances to expose all those great
properties that we created with our
switch item. So now when I select that I
have our switch item where I can toggle
everything between selected unselected
so on and so forth. And again you can
also do some prototyping here as well.
Um where if like while hovering you go
you know here on click you know you go
here while hovering you go here while
hovering you go here and then on click
you know you go here. Okay so you can
add some prototyping uh there as well.
And beautiful there's our switch. Sorry.
And I realized I made a catastrophic
mistake. This should not say radio
button. This should say switch. I
clearly need more coffee today. I don't
know why I had radio buttons on my mind,
but anyways, correcting that. Don't do
that. Sorry about that. That's on me.
Okay, so now let's go ahead and let's
look at our text area. So for our text
area, we're going to actually reuse our
label component now. So again, hopefully
you can see how like using a label
component allows you to bring that into
other components beyond just an input
that you might need. Okay. So, what
we're going to do here is uh maybe just
a trick what you can do is if we just
take this. Okay. And then just bring it
into uh our text area here.
We can extend it out. But first, let's
uh hide that icon. And we can just
detach this. Okay. Um and now just
extend this down. Okay. So, it just
saves us from having to rebuild that
first part again. But we're still going
to need to go ahead and add in our
properties because if we think about
like our our text field, text area, it's
different than a field because a text
area might be for like long form text,
you know, tell me about like your your
medical history, I don't know, something
like that where you need to give the
user a little bit more space. So that's
why we're just extending that down. In
terms of the height, it's really up to
you how like tall or how high you want
like your your fields and stuff like
that. Um, it ultimately doesn't matter
at the end of the day. Um, so there's
really no right or wrong answer here. So
with that, um, one thing you can do if
you really wanted to is actually, uh,
put this as like a text area. Okay, dot
text area and then create the component
of this and then the instance will get
attached to the label. Okay, so now you
have you have control over your text
area and also your label with me so far?
So with that is we still do need to go
ahead and add in these read add in these
properties because remember we just
detached our initial component. So
starting off with our icon left our icon
uh left. There we go. And then also add
in an instance swap for that icon left.
You guessed it. Added emojis and
symbols. Downward facing arrow.
There we go. Uh create the property.
Same for icon rights. Layer property.
icon right. Icon right and then instance
swap icon right.
Icon right. There we go. And then also
uh for our maybe we'll set this for our
body uh our text body. And then maybe
just layer property for like the the
label. Okay.
Create property for uh oops sorry I
didn't mean to do that. Detach. Create
property for the label. Okay. So, this
is good in theory, right? With me so
far. But what's different about a field
like a regular field versus a text area
is that the text the field like it's
just going to be if I was to shrink this
back down, it's just going to be on one
line. Like the lines aren't going to be
overlapping, right? But all of a sudden
with a text area, what's going to happen
is you you're going to have more than
one line of text. and all of a sudden if
you have this icon left, it's going to
be really really weird if like there's
just a bunch of space on either side.
So, got you there because what we're
actually going to do is we're going to
remove that icon left. And now we can
just remove the icon left. Icon left.
And it looks like we have uh an issue
here. So, let me see what I did. So,
let's just say we're just going to set
this to icon. And then set just set this
uh to icon. Okay.
So, uh, conflicting property names, and
we're just going to remove that. And
sorry, that shouldn't be the instance.
There we go. Perfect. So, now on our
text area, we have icon and icon, okay,
that we can toggle on. And we don't need
to worry about that icon left causing
unnecessary white space. Okay, I did
that for a reason. I just wanted to show
you just so you'll learn. Okay, so now
we have our text area here. Uh, let's go
ahead and uh create the component of
this. You can also add some hint copy
here if you'd like or also some
character counts um if you would really
like to. So maybe just for hint copy,
what you can do is just like hint copy
in the middle. Uh drag it in. You can
also create uh use make sure the hint
copy is its own component. If you'd like
to have like exercise some control over
that, you set that to our text
placeholder. So if it's a little bit
light and you can add in a layer
property here uh for hint copy
hint copy and then of course add in a
layer a text property for that hint
copy. Hint copy as well. Edit emojis and
symbols downward facing arrow.
There we go. Just like that. Okay. So
then there we have uh our text area.
Maybe just adjust the the gap there to
12. And one thing we notice is we want
to expose nested instances for both our
label and also our text area. So now
when I click that I see we have all
those great properties to choose from.
So beautiful. There we have uh our teext
area and our text area. And let me
confirm something here. Perfect. So we
also have still have this set to our
surface default. So I think we're in
some good shape. If you wanted to add
some character count text, you can do
that below. Just make sure to add in
like that layer property and also um
like the text property as well. So
perfect. There's your text area. Okay.
So next, let's look at our tab bar. We
need to start off with our tab bar item.
So just so we can put like um what's
word? Like UI collective, I don't know,
something like that. Okay, let's set it
to a body text body. And uh let's go
ahead and add in uh some icons here.
Maybe just like a
it'll go with like a heart or something.
I don't know. Or favorites. I forget
what it's called. Yeah, there we go. Uh,
we have our favorite. Again, set it to
20 by 20. You don't have to, but I just
like my icons a little bit smaller.
Okay. And let's go ahead and play around
here. Okay. So, let's set it to hug and
hug our text. Keep things nice and snug.
So, it's eight. Now, if you know me,
you'll know with my tabs, I only like an
icon on my left. You can have an icon
right if you want to. I'm not going to
include it. So, I'm going to set
horizontal padding of 12 and a vertical
padding where we want to go. Maybe like
12. Kind of looks a little bit buttony,
a little bit big. Maybe 128. I don't
know. I think that's fine. Okay. So,
with this now, um
trying to think, do we want to add a
fill? You can add a fill if you want to.
It sort of depends on if your tab bar is
going to be set sitting on like um like
what background it's usually going to be
sitting on. So you can add a fill if you
want to, but if you want to maintain
that transparent look, you don't need to
have a fill. Okay. Um okay. So let's
call this our tab uh item tab item.
And let's create the component and start
adding some properties here. So maybe
for our icon, maybe we want to set it to
like our icon action just to like start
to offer some differentiation. I think
that's not half bad. And then let's go
ahead uh and start building adding some
properties here. So we're going to add
in a text property for the label.
There we go. And then add in a layer
property for the icon
icon. And then a text an instance swap,
sorry, for also that icon. And then I
use the downward facing arrow to do
this. So I go edit emojis and symbols
and find that downward facing arrow.
There we go.
So now I can turn on and off that icon.
Also change uh the label uh as well.
Okay. So now that we have our initial
tab item all set up, let's go ahead and
start adding some variants. So let's go
ahead and add in some variants here. So
we're going to have uh our status and
this here is going to be our default.
Uh there we go. And then if we extend
this out, this one here is going to be
our hover. So for our hover, I'm sure
you guessed it by now, action hover. And
then you can go like text action hover
if you'd like to. We're going to add in
a surface here for something like
surface action hover light. Again, you
don't you can you don't necessarily need
a background for your hover. This is
where like find a style of tab that
works good for you that you really like
and just use that. And then we're also
going to need a focus. So I know focus
is like hands down the most tedious. So,
one thing you can actually do is we just
go back to one of your other components.
Um,
maybe if we go back to like our button,
you can actually just copy that focus if
you'd like to. So, you don't need to
redo it all again. And then just paste
it in and then again just position it to
pixels on either side. Readjust it.
Okay. And it's going to maintain all the
properties with it. So, there we have
our focus. If I was to set this to like
hello, still like that focus follows
with it. Okay. So it just saves time
that way. And then what we can do is uh
set this to our disabled.
Okay. And we are going to set this to
our icon disabled and then our text
disabled. There we go. And again, you
can also add a background here if you'd
like to. Um we're just go with like our
surface.
Surface disabled. There we go. Again,
you can do that if you want to in a tab
bar. It might look a little harsh, but
again, to each their own. Um perfect.
So, with that out of the way, let's go
ahead and let's add in a type variant.
That's going to be our unselected. So,
these here are unselected tab items. And
we're going to want to then bring down
these if they are selected, of course.
So, what are the selected tab items? So,
what you can do here is just select each
of them and add in a stroke that's on
the bottom. And that's two pixels in
width. And we're going to set that to
our border uh action. Okay. with the
exception of our hover where that's
going to become our border action hover
and here is going to become our border
disabled.
Okay. So basically what this is showing
is like which one of these is actually
selected. Uh if it's underlined it's
selected. If it's not if it's not
underlined then it's not selected. Think
about just like a logical tab bar. It's
usually the function. So then to piece
together your tab bar is you just extend
a bunch of these out. Okay. So extend a
bunch out. There we go. however many you
want. Again, you can still hide them in
your layers as well. Call this your tab
bar. And then what we're going to do is
we're going to add a stroke on the
bottom of our entire tab bar. So, not
again on the individual like tab items,
but on the overall tab bar itself. Set
this to your border default. And then
just hide a couple. Okay. So, however
many you might have. And then so when
you extend this out, what happens is
that you know there's always like that
linear bar at the bottom of your tab bar
to show that this is a connected
component. So when I set one of them to
selected, like that purple highlights
which one is selected and which ones are
not. Okay. One thing you might also want
to consider doing here is going back and
giving these like a body medium semibold
so it stands out a little bit more.
Medium semibold. medium semibold. Okay,
that's also an option that you can take
just to offer a little bit more
differentiation. And if you have a
really complex icon set, you can even
like uh set it to filled or sorry, I
think um like what's the what's an
example here that didn't work as as I
planned, but you can swap out these
icons. So, as an example, like if it's
filled where we have that favorite
order, you can go with like a favorite
filled. Okay, even offer that level of
differentiation, but that's more
complex. you kind of need like a really
fancy icon set for that. Um, okay. So,
there we have our tab bar component. And
what's one thing that we lost as well,
which is all those nested instances. So,
again, just toggle all of those on. So,
now when I select our tab bar uh on an
instance, I can see I have all those
great items for me to choose from. Okay.
So, make sure there's no overlaps in our
items. Perfect. So, there you have your
tab bar. Okay. So, next what we're going
to be looking at here uh is our button
group. So, for our button group, it's
kind of like a little bit of a simpler
component, believe it or not, where you
can put like button group. Okay, we
don't want this to be the medium
semifold, just the medium. And set this
to our text body. Okay, so we're going
to do add some auto layout just like
that. Okay, maybe set this to like 12
and like 12. I don't know. It depends
how large you want your button group
ultimately. And for this, we're actually
going to add a surface. Okay, which is a
default. Then we're going to add a
stroke which is going to be a border
default one pixel
border width of one just on that right
hand side. Okay. Um let's go ahead and
um you know what maybe we'll do? We'll
add in also um an icon here. It's going
to be a heart. Again, 20 by 20. Just me
adjusting things. Uh we'll add in a
heart as well and call this our uh
button group. I item
dot button group item. There we go. So,
let's create the component. And there we
go. Let's add in some properties now.
So, first off, we can add in uh an icon
property or layer property and then a
instance swap similar as we've done
before. Edit mode using symbols. Where's
that downward facing arrow?
Just like that. Perfect.
Um, and I'm still seeing that that Figma
bug where like if you recall back to our
menu where even though there's only one
border here, when I like copy the
components, all of a sudden it looks
like it's adding it all the way around,
which is so weird. I've never seen that
before. So, I think we're just going to
have to manually reset it again every
time.
Um, yeah, I don't know what's going on.
Okay, anyways, so there we have um our
icon and again, just one for our label,
too. a text property for our label. One
thing you can also do as well if you
want to is you can also add um a layer
property for the label. Okay. Um and
then add a text property for the label.
If you want to have like a button
toggle, you can also do that. That's
also an option. Edit emojis and symbols.
Where's that downward arrow? Okay, there
we go. Beautiful. Okay. Awesome. So now
what we're going to do is uh set this
just to right again. Okay. Uh and now
let's go ahead and add in a variant.
So with this we're just going to add in
a hover. Uh so let's go action hover
lights text action hover icon action
hover border uh action hover. And then
let's add in a selected. Okay. So, let's
add in uh a selected version. This is
going to be our action, our border
action, our icon on action, and our text
on action.
Okay. And then lastly, we're going to
need uh a disabled. You know, it's
pretty rare use case to have something
disabled with some of these, but good to
include it anyway. Border disabled. Uh
text
disabled. Icon disabled. Okay, there we
go. So, when it comes to your button
group, what you're doing is just like
really just combining some of these and
see it did it again where it added uh
that item all the way around. So, copy
did it again. Whatever. So, let's just
uh keep manually making that fix. Add
some auto layout between them. Uh set
that to zero. And look what it did. It
added it on all sides now. Um so, let's
set that back to right again. And now on
our button group.
Okay. Uh what we can do, we can create
the component of this. Bring a symbol
down for testing. And it looks like
every time we make a change here, it
just keeps adding it adding back like
that those borders. So I'm not sure
what's going on with Figma. But let's
add in a stroke, okay, on the outside of
this or inside. It doesn't really
matter. And set this to our border
defaults. And then set the radius to
something like four. Okay. And when we
do that, one thing we're going to have
to do as well is just turn clip content
on in order to ensure that we achieve
the look that we're going for. And then
what we can do uh is set this. Oops, I
didn't set uh my apologies here because
I didn't name our properties. This is
going to be our default. This is going
to be our hover.
This here is going to be our selected.
And this is going to be our disabled.
Again, we're kind of merging like status
and types here. Um but it is what it is.
so you can show what one is going to
look like if it's selected. And again,
one thing we just might want to do is
just hardcode this just to the right.
There we go. And there we have uh our
button group component. Now, you can
also add some different variants. So if
like you want to remove just like the um
each of these like you don't want to
have like the label you can be like uh
button you know type
toggle
button toggle
um or button group and then button
um icon group you know like you can get
you can kind of get tricky with it and
finicky but um yeah there you can play
around different variants as much as you
need to for your individual use case.
Um, and there you go. There you have
your button group. Okay. So, now let's
look at our link component. Okay. So,
set this as like a link. And let's go
ahead and add in like a like a home icon
for one and then like uh an arrow icon
for another or like a window like
external window.
Open.
Yeah, there we go. Open and new.
Something like that. So, let's go ahead
add some auto layout. Uh, and just set
this, of course, like a hug and a hug.
Uh I'm not too sure why that got set to
absolute position, but we'll fix that.
And of course, uh set to 20 by 20. Okay,
both of the icons to 20 x 20. And we can
set the gap to something like 12 or some
or eight. Doesn't really matter. Okay,
so there's our link. Now, let's create
the component of this. Um so with
um our link is let's set that actually
before I forget to text body. Sorry, I'm
always getting to do that these days. is
we're going to start with our layer
property for icon left and then our
instant swap for icon left.
Sorry, you'll see I changed my shirt. Uh
then add in a downward facing arrow.
There we go. You can just copy that. And
then what we're going to do the same for
our icon right.
Remove that arrow. Icon right. There we
go. And then same thing. Okay. icon.
Right, there we go. So now on our
instance, I can toggle on and off those
icons. Also swap those icons. And then
we're going to need just a text property
uh for the label, but we're always going
to need a label for our link. Okay. Uh
there we go. So toggle that on and off.
And then
uh I think we're looking in some pretty
good shape. So let's go ahead and add in
uh a variant here. One that's going to
be uh our hover. First, this is going to
be our status. Uh, this is going to be
our default. And then this here is going
to be our hover.
So, what you can do is set this to your
action hover and then your text action
hover. And then we're also going to need
a focus. This here is going to be our
focus. So, very similar to what we did
with some of the other ones is we can
just go maybe just go back to our tab
bar, uh, select the focus,
go back to our link, and then paste it
around. Okay. Okay, but we're just going
to need to make some adjustments here,
of course. So, that stays two pixels on
either side. And I can see it's still
set to left and right and also top and
bottom, which is perfect. Exactly what
we want to see. And then also, uh, we're
going to need it disabled.
Okay. So, our icon is going to be our
disabled. And then our text is also
going to be our disabled. One thing you
can also do if you like really want to
to offer like some differentiation for
you could add like a surface disabled
just to show it's like, hey, you can't
click this at all. Just make sure to add
in a quick radius here of something like
two, just so it looks a little bit
clean. Okay, so there we have uh our
link component. I think we're in some
pretty good shape. So, one thing you can
also do as well with your link is you
can add in like a different type. So,
this might be um I'll show you what I
mean here real quick. Uh so, you can add
a new variant which is going to be type.
This might be basic. This might be your
uh even like your default link. Maybe
you might one thing you might also want
to do is for your hover make that's like
your body link. Okay, it's just to show
some differentiation. And then what you
can do is what's called like an inline
again there's different terminologies
for it where everything else is uh has
that link but that hover might not have
that link. Okay, so it's kind of just
inversed at the end of the day and
there's just a different like variant
set for you. Okay, perfect. So there we
have our link. So now that we have our
link component, we can use that link
component to build out our breadcrumb.
Okay. Um,
perfect. There we go. So, for our
breadcrumb, what we're going to do is
maybe set that icon right to like that
um, right or chevron, right? There we
go. And then what we're going to do is
uh, copy and paste and then hide that
icon left. Okay. So, hopefully now you
can see how it's already starting to
look like a little bit of a breadcrumb.
And if we set this to 12 and you can
control the number of links you want to
cap in your breadcrumb just using your
layers. Um, so maybe only in six, which
is kind of best practice that you don't
want to have any more links than that in
your breadcrumb. You can just leverage
it as such. So you can create that
breadcrumb and then hide a couple. Okay?
So maybe only have three. But one thing
that's important to note is that for the
last one of a breadcrumb, you can't
really go anywhere else, right? So
you're going to have to hide that icon,
right? And then maybe you might want to
uh set that uh as in line to show like
that's where you are. Okay, that's an
option. But then um as if you were to
hide other layers, like if I was to hide
the last three, because maybe I only
have three, you'd have to apply that
same treatment. So a hack is whenever
you have that last one, maybe just hide
all the other ones before it, which
isn't best practice, but it just saves
you like saves you, what's the word I'm
looking for?
The hassle of having to hide the icon,
reapply like the property, all that fun
stuff. But of course, we still need our
nested instances. So, we can toggle
those on.
Perfect. So, now on a copy of our
breadcrumb, we have all of these great
properties for us to choose from. And
again, we can hide our our hidden uh
breadcrumb items, also known as our link
components, uh or reshow them from our
layers panel itself. Okay, so a
breadcrumb nice and easy component for
us. Let's keep moving forward. Okay, so
let's go ahead and let's build out an
avatar now. So for this, what we're
going to do is we're going to search for
like our user like a profile. Um
profile
profile. Let's see what comes up. Person
maybe.
Um I forget the specific icon. There we
go. Person outline. I think that's okay.
Um okay. So what we're going to do
actually is we are going to set this to
something pretty large like 64 by 64 to
start. And what we are going to do is
we're going to add uh an auto layout
frame. Okay, with me so far? And one
thing we're going to do is we're going
to add in a fill, which is going to be
our surface default. And let's set the
page background just so you can see uh
what's going on here. So, um what I'm
I kind of like my largest avatar to be
64x 64. Okay. So, let's actually set the
parent frame 64x 64 and then apply in
that radius, which should be round. Now,
what we're going to do, okay, is even if
we were to center it inside is this kind
of looks a little bit awkward. So, we're
actually going to use our absolute
positioning tool on the icon itself and
extend it out. As you can see, just like
this. So, try to get it as center as
possible. There we go. And then if you
select the parent frame and turn on clip
content, what that's going to do is
going to give you the look of the avatar
that you're going for. because our icon
is a little bit weird. Even though I
just set it to fill. Yeah, it's just
just still not right. Again, you can
play around with different avatars here,
different icons here for your avatar uh
if you'd like to. And there we go. Okay.
So, there is uh our first avatar.
So, uh I can see the size is 64x 64. And
this is where if we were to create the
component of this and add another
variant, we can play around some
different sizes, right? So, uh, what I
mean by that, if we have 64x 64, maybe
we have a 32x 32.
Um, that might even be too big. Let's
48x 48. 48x 48. There we go. Something
in the between. So, this is size. This
might be our large. This might be our
medium.
And then what you can do is just like
shrink it down so it kind of looks
pretty similar.
There we go. This here is our medium.
And then you might also have a small.
Okay, so with the small, maybe that's
where we get into something like 32 by
32. And then really just adjust that
icon
just like that. Okay, so there's your
first like avatar. And what we can call
this is also like in terms of a type,
this is our icon avatar. Icon avatar.
What we can also do is maybe I might
also just want to add in a quick stroke
here as well to offer some
differentiation. border default. There
we go. One thing we can also do is we
can also add in uh an image icon, an
image type. So for this, what we're
going to do, we can just simply get rid
of um the image on the inside and then
add in or add in, sorry, if we were to
add in instead of that surface defaults,
uh what we could do is set it to uh an
image. There we go. And maybe I'll
upload an image a little bit later on
just so you can see it so you don't need
to see my messy files. Um, so there is
also our image variance. And then one
thing I realized here, make sure that's
lowercase. And then you can do the same
thing for initials.
So if I was to take my initials here,
KM, that's me. Uh, set it to maybe like
our
large semibold.
There we go.
Copy it. again remove the icons here and
paste it inside.
Maybe want to might make it a little bit
bigger. So for this one, maybe you might
want to go with an H5. This one, maybe
you might want to go with an H6. Again,
depending on what feel you're going for.
And in this one, maybe you might want to
make it like a paragraph.
Large is still too big. Maybe a medium,
medium semibold. There we go. And one
thing you should also do as well is just
set this to hug and hug just so it stays
nice and snug in the center.
And you can also do it with the width as
well,
but it doesn't really matter. Okay, so
there we go. There we have uh some of
our initials. And if you really wanted
to get fancy on me here, one thing you
could also do is you also add a layer
property or text property, sorry, for
the initials.
Beautiful. So, we're in some great shape
for our avatar there. And now one thing
you can also do is um you can like
create different like groups of these.
Okay. So if I was to like set a bunch of
them, add a bunch of them here. Um but
first so you know let me add like four
or five. Okay. And then maybe we can uh
set the gap to like -4 so they overlap.
And then this last one you set it to
like plus 12. Okay. It sort of shows
that there's a bunch of other users who
are part of this group. That's what's
called an avatar group.
So you can use your avatars to sort of
create like a bunch of different
components. So there's your avatar
group. And then one thing you can also
even do is sort of just like an avatar
label. So pretty similar to what we did
with like our checkbox and things. So
you have your avatar label. Set this to
your, you know, your body. Uh there we
go. Even this is kind of kind of large.
So maybe we can just set that to a
small.
Just to a small. There we go. You might
even have like your avatar label. So,
that's where you can also create
different sizes for your avatar label if
like you'd really like to flip this to
12. Make sure that's assigned left. Uh
avatar uh label. And you can even say
the name. So, if this is like I don't
know uh if you're a soccer fan like Cole
Palmer. Cole Palmer. If they don't have
like an image for their name. Okay. You
can create the components. uh add in uh
that text property for the label.
Oh, but what you can also do is of
course add in the layer property. So
label and then label
with the downward facing arrow of
course. Edit emojis and symbols downward
facing arrow.
There we go. Um and of course be sure to
add in the text body. There we go. So
now you sort of have three components
and sort of what from sort of one group.
Okay. So there is our avatars uh all out
of the way. Okay. So with our avatar out
of the way, let's go ahead and let's
build our tag. So over this, we're just
going to put like a tag here. Now
there's a couple different types of tags
that you can take. We're just going to
do one which is our interactive tag for
now. Okay. So, for our interactive tag,
let's look for our plus to start.
R plus our add.
There we go. Plus, perfect. And let's
add some auto layout. Okay. Set this to
hug and hug. And we're going to play
around with the gap. So, that's like
eight. Horizontal padding to like 12.
Vertical padding to also like 12. Let's
also add in a stroke which is going to
be our uh border
um action. There we go. Sorry, you might
hear some noise outside. There is a big
fair uh going on in Toronto and I hear
it. Um okay, so let's set this as like a
a radius to four. And then also maybe
this set this icon to our icon action.
Okay. So sort of show that something has
the option to be selected. Okay. So
we're going to call this our tag item.
dot tag item and then let's create the
component of this. Now, one thing we
might also want to do is also add in
like a surface default. So, let's go
ahead add in a variant
and we're going to focus on our hover to
start. So, our hover, we're going to
have our action hover lights, our oops,
sorry, this should also be our text
body.
And then this here should be our text
action hover. And then our icon action
hover. There we go. And then of course
we're also going to want our focus.
So this is our hover. This is our
default. Sorry. This is our status.
And when it comes to our focus, we can
still do the same thing. Just copy uh
one of our focuses from we had before.
Paste it. Oops, that's not what I wanted
to do. I meant to copy the focus.
There we go. Just like that. And then we
can set it to two pixels on either side.
Beautiful. So, we have left and right,
top and bottom. And uh did I set my
properties for this? I did not set my
properties for this. So, what I can do
is just select the tag here uh using the
uh select multi matching layers tool. We
can create the property for that all at
once. And we're only going to have a
text property. We're not going to have a
layer property, meaning we're only going
to have the option to change the text
and not actually change everything else
and not actually hide the text, excuse
me. So, we're in some decent shape. Uh,
and one thing also we just might want to
do is also have uh a disabled, of
course. So, we're going to add in our
surface disabled, our border disabled,
and also our icon disabled, and set this
to our text disabled. Perfect. I think
we're in some good shape for our tag
item, but we still do need some other
variants associated with that. So, let's
do that next. Okay, so now let's add
like another selected variant onto these
tags. One thing I did is I just renamed
this tag cuz I don't know why I did tag
items. Anyways, clearly need more coffee
today. I'll tell you that. So, let's go
ahead. Let's add in a variant. It's
going to be our type. Okay. And these
ones are going to be our unselected to
start. And again, just maintain
consistency across what we've done with
other components. And these here are
going to be our selected. Okay. So, with
that, what we're going to do, we're just
going to swap all all of these, not the
top group, just these ones for a close.
There we go. And then we're going to set
all of the the borders
uh not to a dash, but back back to a
solid line.
Then we adjust uh so it's going to be
our surface action. Border action is
going to remain the same.
This is going to become our text on
action and our icon on action. Uh for
here we can do a surface action hover uh
border action hover text on action icon
on action maintain the same as we did
here. So text action border focus icon
on action uh text on action and then our
what's the word I'm looking for our
disabled can can stay the same. Okay. So
there we have our unselected and our
selected tag options. Um and again so
sort of thought process is like you know
while while hovering
on click it comes here shows that it's
selected uh while hovering you know
while hovering and then on on selected.
So there you go. There you have what's
called an interactive tag components. Uh
we're just going to call it a tag
components and keep rocking and rolling.
Okay. So next let's go ahead let's look
at our loader. Now, when it comes to
your loader, like
it's there's a bunch of different things
that you can do with your loader in
terms of like the style that you want.
Okay, so what I always tend to do, we're
going to build kind of just an ugly
loader if I'm honest. So, we're going to
bring in this loader and maybe we just
let's actually uh set it to the back.
Again, there's a bunch of different
types of loaders that you can you can
have. Okay. So, we're just going to uh
go like this. Loader on all four sides.
Just try to get it as close to as
possible. I think that looks a little
bit too too ugly. So, let's set it to
maybe like 14. And then 14. And how tall
is our frame here? So, it's 85 by 85. I
think maybe if we shrink it down
actually to 64 x 64.
64x 64.
So, let's bring in all of our loaders.
Just like that.
All of our loaders. Just position it.
So, if you picture these are just sort
of like going around in in a circle in a
way. Okay, that's basically the look
that I'm going for is these would it
would just be like a rotating loader
more often than not. Okay, so we can
remove the fill and then set these to
our surface action. And uh let's go
ahead and create the component of this.
Okay, so this is set to 64x 64. One
thing I'm going to want to do is I'm
actually going to set each of these to
scale and scale. And the reason why I'm
going to do that is when we add
additional sizes here,
when we add additional sizes, if I was
set this to 48 by 48, notice how the
circles scale down with the actual
loader. Okay. So, if this is our size,
this would be our large. Maybe we might
have a medium. And then maybe we might
also have a small. And here, this might
be like a 34 32x 32.
32x 32. Okay. And again, there's a ton
of different types of loaders that you
can actually build. Like you can do ones
where it's like um fight drop to fill
out add a stroke, you know, like ones
ones like this in a way where you kind
of just like nice looking loaders like
that. There's a ton of different options
that you can do uh for your loaders. But
that's really just how you can you just
set them up in like the grand scheme of
things. Okay, so loader is a really
simple component. Um it doesn't take
much uh to build. I want to show you
another trick that you can do in terms
of like your loaders and also like
interaction wise. So say you have like
four of these, right? So if I'm going to
I'm going to add some auto layout here.
Maybe I'm going to set this one to like
the purple. Okay. And then I create the
component is then when I add a variant
here and this is like fun tricks that
you can do is just move this one all the
way to the end. Just move this one. Just
move this one. Okay. And basically what
you're going to do is like uh after a
delay of 200 milliseconds, after a delay
of 200 milliseconds,
200 milliseconds, and then after a delay
of 200 milliseconds, after a delay of
200 milliseconds,
and then lastly, after delay of 200
milliseconds.
Right? So then if I was to go ahead
place this in a quick frame and then
preview it. Let's just see here. You
preview it. It's a little small, but
see how like things start to load. So
you can play around with like some
different treatments for your loader.
And that felt like a little bit robotic,
but there's a lot of things that you can
do for your loader component like that
to sort of show that something's
loading. Okay, but this is a real simple
loader um that I see quite frequently.
Okay, so picture like this just like
spinning round and around and around and
round and around to show that
something's loading. Okay, again, each
their own. Uh, and there you go. There
you have a loader component. Okay, so
next let's go ahead and let's do our
badge. So when it comes to our badge,
we're going to add some text here. It's
just like 99. Oops, 99. And we're just
set this to um we'll actually go with
our body small. So our 14 semib bold in
this case. Of course, set this to our
text body. So let's go ahead. Let's add
some auto layout here. Maybe shrink this
to like 4x4. This we like it nice and
snug. But this needs to be set to hug
and hug. Okay. Um, now one thing I like
to do is just you can just hardcode the
width. Set it to something like 24. And
you're going to see why. But if I was to
set this to our surface action. I'm
going to want to set it to around. Okay.
And we always want our badge to be like
that nice crisp clean circle. Okay. And
hard coding the width, the height and
width like 24 x 24 allows us to do that.
So then we can go with our text on
action and call this our badge. So where
badges usually come into play is if I
was to go back and like take an avatar
component here. Okay. So if you picture
like an avatar component, you might
have, you know, your badge. Oops. Bring
to front. There you go. You might have
your badge like resting on it. That's an
example for like a shopping cart. You
know, if you're buying online, see how
many items are in your cart. That's
where a badge comes into play. So let's
create uh the component of this and
let's add a variant here. So let's add a
couple variants. So one of which uh
let's go with our status. So this is
going to be our defaults. We also might
have an error here. So this is where we
can set it to our surface error. Um and
then our text error. Okay. I'm not a big
fan of that approach in my honest
opinion. So, one thing you might want to
consider is like you can go back and
adjust some of your surfaces to make
them a little bit light, a little bit
darker, but then that might impact other
components like an alerts. But because
this is so small, one thing you can do
is really just use like your icon error
and set your text to your text on
action, okay, to maintain like that
level of like cleanness. And you can
even do something like a success as well
where you just swap it for the success
and then an information
where you just swap it for an
information
and another one where you just swap it
uh for your warning.
Okay,
warning. And then also too if you always
be sure again so to also add a layer
property for that badge count. So select
one use the multi select tool and just
add a text property. Sorry, not a layer
property uh for the count. So now when I
bring one of these out, I can change
that to like 98. Okay. Now we can also
add another variant group here. So if
this is going to be type type, this
might be our default. So these here are
all our default. Click that lowerase. We
might also want one that's just like a
dot. So with the dot, it's almost like
if you have like 101, you know, you just
want to show that you have like some
level of like alerts, but you don't
necessarily need to specify a value.
What you can then do is set these to 12
and 12. Just delete everything inside
and then set them to 12 x 12. And now
you have just like your dot badge. Okay.
And again, I can see there's no overlaps
here, but I think these ones are still
variant, too. Yeah. So these should
actually be air. And let me just make
sure that these are all named right. So
perfect. We have our default error
success information warning. Beautiful.
There we have a badge component. And so
now let's work on our progress bar. So
for our progress bar, if we set this to
maybe like 200 as a width and a height
of maybe something like eight. Okay.
What we're going to do, we're going to
add a fill which is going to be our
surface. Uh action hover light. And
let's also set the radius to something
like round. Okay. And we'll call this
progress.
Now, a little trick that I do, I'm going
to add two ellipses. Okay. And then I'm
going to add some auto layout between
them. Call this frame adjust gap. Sorry,
I'm sure my face is covering it. Or
maybe it's not. Um, call this frame
adjust gap. And then set the sizes of
both ellipses to zero.
Then simply increase the size of that
frame. Let's add a fill here. And you're
going to see why I did this. This is
like a really like this is a better
trick, this one. Okay. And then place it
inside.
And then just match the height of it.
Okay. And also be sure set that radius
as well uh to round to keep things nice
and consistent. So now when I create the
component of this progress bar, notice
how this locks because it's the
component. I would have to like increase
the the width of this on the main
component in order for it to change. But
on the instance, if I select the adjust
gap and set it to 200.
Oops, sorry. I was had the fix the width
locked. So, set that to hug. Okay.
Notice how all of a sudden using the
adjust gap, it's took the width that I
set the gap to be. So, if I set it to
150, now all of a sudden, I don't need
to break my component every time. I can
just simply adjust the gap. Cool trick,
right? So, that's a little bit of a
veteran trick for you in terms of your
progress. And one thing you can even do
is this is kind of like too tall. I kind
of like mine to be like four and then
also like four. Keep it nice and thin.
Um, beautiful. Yeah. So, there you have
uh your progress uh bar uh progress bar
because one thing you might also want to
do is also have a label where it's like
uh completion.
set this to our small and also body
because one thing you might also want to
do is have some level of uh like a label
for it like completion um 80 or 80%.
Again, just an option what you might
want to do. So add some auto layout
here. Set this to to hug and hug. There
we go. And now you can call this your
progress bar.
And again, if you if you want your
progress bar to be even like a little
bit thicker, you can you have that
option as well. You know, just make it
the made progress bar like eight pixels
tall instead of four. Again, you can
always just still keep adjusting the
gap. So, if I want to set this to 80%,
so like something like 160 and have that
option to do so. So, let's create the
component. And one thing we want to do
is add, of course, add in first set this
to fill. Add in a layer property here
for the label. And then add in a text
property also for the label. Beautiful.
There you go. Then we go edit emojis and
symbols. Where is our downward facing
arrow?
There we go. Perfect. So now on our main
component, we can turn that on and off
and also adjust uh the gap as well.
Okay. So there's your progress bar. And
let's look at our progress circle real
quick. Let's look at our progress
circle. So for a progress circle, what I
do is just I just add um just a like a
canvas here um or a circle, sorry. And
what I do then is I just sort of extend
this out and just play around with it
until I get exactly what I'm looking
for. And then I re rejoin it. So you're
just playing around like the different
circle controls. Um and we're going to
set this to our surface
action hover lights. And then what we're
going to do just copy and paste another
ellipse on top. And we're going to set
this one to our surface action. And now
we can control sort of the width of
that. Right? So now so you can sort of
see like what that progress might might
look like. Okay. And so you can also use
this as a loader component as well. And
this is kind of tall as is. Maybe we set
this to like 64 um and 64. I might need
to reposition it. Sorry, that one is on
me. Perfect. There we go. And then what
we can do is we can actually just frame
this.
There we go. condense this down just so
it's um
perfect. 64 and 64. Uh beautiful. And I
think we're in some pretty good shape
here. So, this can be like our progress
circle. One thing you might also want to
do um is
you can add some text on the inside,
something like 80% if you'd like to. So,
set this to your body
and just paste it uh in on the inside.
Just like that. Position it in the
center. And now if you were to create
the component of this. There you go.
Okay. So, one thing too uh as well that
you might want to consider is again
remember how I talked about like setting
things to scale and scale. So, if we had
another decided to add another variant
here, what you could do is 64x 64, 48x
48. Notice how that scales down. You
just need to adjust the text inside of
it. Okay. So there's another trick for
you uh as well uh if you'd like. And of
course maybe you might not want that
text on the inside. So you can add in a
uh layer property here of course for the
label and also a text property of course
for the label uh as well. So then we can
go edit emojis and symbols bring in that
downward facing arrow and away we and
away uh we go. Okay, beautiful. Let's uh
keep rocking in our roll in. And of
course we can call this uh sort of our
size which is our default if we did have
other sizes as well. Okay, perfect.
There we go. So there we have our
progress bar and our progress circle.
Okay, so next let's bring our snack
build our snack bar. Sorry. So with our
snack bar, let's set it to like um let's
go hello and set it like our body
medium. Sorry, I was looking for that.
Actually, no, we'll go with our body
large actually. Let's spruce things up a
bit. Um and set this. So, we're going to
set this to our uh text action the
starter. Even though it's not an action
element, maybe we can even go with the
semol too. We'll get fancy with things.
Okay. So, let's call this our snack bar
uh title. And um going ahead here, let's
also add in some more text. And this is
going to be our text body. And we're
going to set this to our medium. And
what we can do is just add in some basic
text like you know Lauram
Ipsum is the standard
uh dummy text of the design industry
something like that. Okay so in some
decent shape we're just going to add in
all the components and then structure
it. So we're also going to bring in a
link components. Let's also bring in uh
a closable. So, a close. Um, and let's
also go ahead and bring in um what's the
word I'm looking for? Like an info.
There we go. An info. So, see how we're
sort of like structuring the snack bar a
little bit. So, one thing I want to do
start is that to do to start is I'm
going to add uh a frame here that we're
going to call content and then select
our closable or other icon. Okay. And
sort of serve as the basis for
everything else. So maybe we can set
that to like a 12. Now one thing that's
important to note here is depending on
how wide we want the snack bar, we're
always going to want the close always at
the end. Okay. So uh using fill we solve
that issue. And let's now play around
with our auto layout. So like 12 or like
18 even by like 24.
I think that's decent for for a snack
bar. And then add in a fill surface
default stroke which is going to be our
border. uh defaults and let's also add
in a radius as well. Okay, so that
radius is going to be something like
eight and maybe also set this to 18 by
18. Okay, I don't think that's so bad.
Okay, so we're in some decent shape
here. Now, going back to our link
component, if you really wanted to take
your design system to a whole another
level is you could also have like colors
for your links, too. So, if we were just
to override these for now, just give you
an idea as to what that might look like.
It sort of like can spruce up your snack
bar a little bit. And so we set this to
something like learn more. Maybe hide
that icon left and set that icon right
to uh chevron.
There we go. It looks a little bit more
realistic uh that way. Okay, perfect. So
maybe we also might want to set our icon
action to purple. And I think we're in
some good shape here. Okay, sweet. Um,
what also might we want to do to this
snack bar here is maybe if we go into
our progress bar, um, we'd be able to
maybe just pull it in, but absolute
position it so that it stays at the
bottom. And the reason why we might want
to do that is maybe like there's a
timeout for the snack bar where it's
like almost like giving you a little bit
of a warning like, hey, like something's
wrong like or take action here. And then
so we might want that at the end. Again,
it's just a nice to have more than
anything else. So if we set a horizontal
padding to something like 100, that
looks a little bit more realistic. But
let's just make sure we set that to the
bottom and also to the left and right.
And what that's going to do is if I
extend this out, uh the progress bar is
going to follow with it and always keep
it to the bottom uh as I extend that
down. Okay, so that's why our
constraints there. Super duper
important. Okay. So, let's call this our
snack bar. And let's create the
component of this. And let's play around
with a couple things here. So, maybe um
I think we're always going to want the
the content. Let's just say we do in
this case, but maybe we might not want
this icon left. So, what we can do,
sorry, is add in a layer property for
this icon left
and also add in uh an instance swap for
this icon left as well. So we can easily
swap out that icon to something else.
There we go. Just like that. And then
maybe uh for our closable, maybe we just
want a layer property for the close.
Okay, we we're always going to want it a
close and we never have like another
type of icon in a snack bar. So now we
just have the option to hide that close
uh if we'd like to. Okay. Um
perfect. So we're in some good shape
here. And maybe also as well, maybe we
also just do want to if I select the
snack bar uh sorry on our main component
here. Maybe we also do just want an
option to uh hide that snack bar or hide
the progress bar. So just a layer
property for the progress bar.
Beautiful. Uh so I think we're in some
good shape here. And also just expose
any nested instances if we do have them
um for like the link. And we probably
won't need them for the icons
themselves. So maybe just the link for
now. I think that's pretty good. So,
we're in some decent shape there for our
snack bar, but there's also some
variants that we can add for our snack
bar. So, things like, you know, if this
is our this is our status or type, you
know, this could be our defaults. Uh,
this could be just based on some of the
other colors that we have. So, it could
be a success icon success surface
success. Um, so this is where we're kind
of having to override some of the colors
here. We don't have variance for those,
but you can create variants for those if
you'd like to. Um, and because because
our surface success is relatively light,
we might want to set that just icon
success. Again, just make it make it
work. Um, so then if we were to create
another one, you know, maybe we might
have an air if there's something like
urgent that you should take issue of. So
air and then also error. And then we can
also have, you know, a warning. So for
this one, really similar, you know,
warning and then also warning. And then
also really similar to something like an
information. Where is our information?
And then also our information. And then
this here is going to be our
information. There we go. So we have a
bunch of different variants uh for our
snack bar. Looks like this one did not
get named here. Uh and perfect. So our
snack bar is in some pretty good shape.
We can swap between all the variants. We
have our nested instances and some
different types as well. And the snack
bar is a kind of a nice component like
if you're in in an interview being able
to show that you know how to build this
component because it leverages a bunch
of other like atom components. It's
pretty good to to have up your alley. So
there you go. There's your snack bar.
Okay. So let's look at our carousel now.
So um oh sorry not carousel. I shouldn't
be searching. I should be searching for
like our uh chevron
uh chevron left. Okay. So when it comes
to our carousel let's add an auto layout
there. So I just press shift a and maybe
we'll set this to eight and eight.
and let's set it to our icon action.
Let's go ahead and also add a stroke,
which is going to be a border action.
And we're going to set the border width
there to one. And let's set the radius
uh to round.
Beautiful. Let's also set the surface
uh to default and call this our dot
carousel
item. There we go. So, let's go ahead
and then create the component of this.
And now, let's start adding some
variants here. So, a couple variants
that we're going to have is just a hover
and a focus. Um, actually, we can do it
disabled, too, now that I think about
it. Okay, so for our hover, so of
course, let's call it property one, just
the status. And this one here is, of
course, default. And then this here is
our hover. So, for our hover, let's go
with a surface action hover lights and
our icon action hover. And then our
border action hover. And then, of
course, we're going to need a focus as
well.
So for our focus, what we are going to
do uh is let's go back to one of our
maybe our tag component that has that
focus. Actually, we'll go back all the
way back to our radio button actually
because our radio button has a rounder
focus. So let's do that and simply just
plop it uh around
so we don't need to recreate some of the
styling because that's always probably
the worst part. And then try to get it
two pixels on either side. Okay.
And of course, left and right, top and
bottom. And then there we have our
focus. And then we're also going to need
our disabled. So with our disabled, you
know the drill. Just change it out to
your disabled, your icon disabled, and
your border disabled.
And then what we can do is just drag
these down.
And then just select the icons here.
Okay? Because we're going to need and uh
so this can actually be direction. So
these here are going to be our left left
and then these here are going to be our
right
where what we're doing is we're swapping
out each of these icons for the other
one. So chevron left is going to become
our chevron right. Okay. So there we
have uh our carousel item. Next what we
can do uh is look at sort of the bar
that goes in between the carousel items.
So, just as a visual, if you have like a
carousel, maybe you have some images
above, you're like toggling in between,
you're going to want a bar just to show
you like how many how many more might be
left. Okay. So, with this, I always like
to add in a frame here and just set this
to like a surface um I don't know,
action hover light. And let's also set
the radius to round. And then let's make
it uh nice and thin.
And then what we're going to do is just
copy a frame and simply just overlay it
on the inside. So we have one frame
within another. So our first frame we
can call sort of our um scroll not
scroll bar per se, but carousel barous
bar. And then we have our carousel
progress as the other name. Sorry, I
know my my face is probably covering
this. Let me see if I can extend this
up. Perfect. So we have our progress bar
and our carousel progress. And with our
carousel progress, let's like bring it,
you know, like somewhere in the middle
here and just change it to like a
surface action just so we can see it.
Okay. So, a couple things here is as we
extend this out, we're going to want
this to also extend with it. So, if we
set that to scale,
then if I extend this out, notice how
that is also extending with it. So, it's
going to go great for in between our
carousel. So if I was to create the
component of our carousel bar, bring
down a copy here and just place it in
the middle and then set this like 24.
There we have uh our carousel now. Okay.
So um there's a lot that you can do with
this component in terms of like
customization, making things the way
that you like it. Again, even this is
kind of like our carousel bar five
pixels tall. It's kind of weird. Maybe
you want to go with like a four pixel
tall and also set your carousel progress
to four pixels tall to keep things a
little bit more like nice and snug. Um,
but again uh to each their own. Play
around with it as much as you want to in
order to achieve the look that you're
going for. You might also say that maybe
these uh themselves are a little bit too
like wide. So you can even set these to
like four and four for a little bit of
like a more snug look. But and then
there you have uh your carousel. Uh,
also be sure to put a dot in front of
carousol bar so we know not to publish
it. And uh, there we go. There you got
your carousel. Okay, so I want to go
back to our button now uh, and actually
go through and build like a button icon
component. And this is like super easy.
U, button icon component, it's kind of
just used for like most things if I'm
honest. Uh, like think it'd be used for
things like a close, sorry. Um, like a
close um, anywhere where there's just
like a solid icon that's a button. It
can be best practice in order to use
your button icon versus a regular icon
itself. Not to say that like you need to
do that. It does add another lay layer
of complexity, but you can do it. Okay.
So, what I did there is I just copied
our button component, renamed it to
button icon, and I'm just going to
remove the label and the icon right. And
that's only going to leave us with our
icon left. Okay. Now, what's one thing
that we notice here is like this kind of
looks a little bit awkward because
something's off with um our width and
our height. So, I like to have them as a
perfect square. So, I'm going just set
it to 44x 44. And you can just hardcode
it that way. Like it doesn't you don't
nothing needs to be super specific. Um
just depending on the size that you're
going for. Actually, let me check this.
So, I changed my mind actually. Sorry.
Our height is actually 36. So, we're
going to hardcode these to 36x 36. So
there's some level of compl um
consistency there with the button. My
apologies. And then what we're going to
do for all of the properties is now
remove the ones of that were associated
with our icon right and also our label
and just removed icon left. So it's only
uh icon. Okay. So instead of having to
recreate a brand new button icon
component, we can kind of repurpose our
other components in order to in order to
build that. So quick hack there.
Beautiful. There's your button icon.
Okay. Okay, so now let's look at our
table component. Okay, so what we're
going to do is we're just going to bring
in just some copy here. Okay, we're
going to set this to our text body.
Text body. We're going to add some auto
layout. We're going to keep it nice and
thin. Okay, so nice and tight like a 2
by two. Now, we're going to call this
our dot cell item. Cell uh item because
tables are kind of weird because you
need to remember that like Figma was not
built to handle tables. Anyone that
tells you differently, it's really not.
So what this cell item is going to do is
if we picture like a like like a table
cell, okay, or say we have a cell for a
table like your table cell or your cell
item is going to go inside of that cell.
And we can add a bunch of variants here
to like for all these different use
cases. So if I was to add a variant for
this. Okay. Um what we can do is we can
even uh what's the we can even add in
like a checkbox, you know, like a check
um like a checkbox.
Okay, we can include it in there. Of
course, we'd want our checkbox to be a
little bit smaller. So that's where we
need to play around some different
sizes, but we can also play around with
like, you know, like a an icon. Maybe
you want an icon in there. Uh or even
like a link. Let's maybe bring in a
link, right? So we can bring in uh a
link into one of these things um into
one of our cells. Also too, we can even
just add in like icon, right? So maybe
if you just add in like a heart or a
favorite, like a favorite in here. Okay,
set it to 20 by 20.
20 by 20. Get rid of the copy. Just copy
and paste this three times. So now you
have like an action cell, right? So
maybe it's like download edit view more.
So to make it come to life like view
um maybe like I there we go you know
this is edit
edit and maybe this one is like uh
chevron right chevron right? So you
start to play around with the different
items that would go into your cell. Now
for the purposes of this exercise we
might just stop there okay and let you
sort of imagine what this would be. This
would be like our type. Maybe this here
is just like our basic copy. Maybe this
one here is also just our basic uh what
word am I looking for? Sorry, link. And
maybe this one's like a um action, you
know, that go into that cell. Now, what
we're going to do with our cell item is
we're going to bring one of these down
and add an auto layout frame over top of
it. Maybe set it 12 by 12.
And we can probably stop there. Now, one
thing, of course, that we're going to
want to do here is also just add in just
some properties here. So, uh you know,
label and you know, instance swaps for
each of these icons. So, but I'm not
going to do that now. I'll let you do
that. And then what we're do going to do
is call this our cell item or cell,
excuse me.
So, if we create the component of this
now, okay, first off, let's turn on our
nested instances for things like uh our
link. And now what we can do is we can
turn on nested instances for our cell
item. So now when we hit this copy, we
can now swap this out for something like
a link. Again, be sure to set this to
hug and hug. Um, swap it out for a link
uh for your action or also for your copy
as well. Beautiful. Now, when it comes
to your cell is that um you think about
a table, tables can be kind of
structured a little bit differently,
right? You might have a horiz, you might
have tables and rows. You might also
have tables and columns. So, this is
where what you're going to do is
actually just start to break this out a
little bit. Okay. And one thing uh I'd
like to highlight here is let's start
off with maybe just like our column. So,
let's just add a bunch of uh items for
our column. Okay. So, we can call this
our column component. And then when we
extend this out, uh, you can, we have to
make sure everything stays left aligned
here, of course.
Left aligned. There we go. Make sure
these everything in here is proper.
Okay, perfect. So, there we have our
column. Now, these columns would join
together to make a table, right? Nice
and easy. Now, one thing that I would
also like uh to call out is with the
column itself is we're also going to
need some type of header. Okay, so this
is where you can kind of get fancy a
little bit where in the cell you can
have one type that is copy. So, this
would sort of be like your copy or
contents
and then another one that's your header.
with your header, you might override
some of these elements and set it to
like a medium semibold and also maybe
even change the background a bit. Okay,
so for it to be like a surface um maybe
like a surface disabled or it's even
like too strong.
Yeah, we'll leave it as is for now.
Okay, so we'll get rid of that. Maybe
it's just a little bit stronger. So then
in your in your cell, that top one would
be a header component. And if you really
wanted to, again, you can add in sort of
like, let's see what we have here,
like an action hover light. I don't
know, something to signify that like
that's the top part of that cell. Again,
purple's probably not the most ideal
color in the world, but like it is what
it is. Something like that. Okay. Um,
and set that to fill. Beautiful. Now,
something that I would like to call out
here is let's say we have all of these
columns arranged together and then we
create the component of this and we
bring this down. Okay, to like
modify the cell, we actually have to
detach the component again. And we don't
want to we want to avoid having to
detach components as much as we can, but
tables like aren't built that way. So
you're going to recall um in
um some of the earlier components we had
this idea of like a gap of like an
adjust gap component and we're going to
introduce that same concept here. So
this is going to be our column component
to start because again columns are made
up of rows and or tables are made up of
rows or columns. They can't be both. So
we're going to have a column component
to start. Now, one thing we might also
want to do to offer some differentiation
is add a stroke just on the bottom.
We'll reset that to a border default. So
now it looks a little bit more
realistic. So now what we're going to do
for uh our adjust gap is if you recall
like during cuz the thing that's tricky
about like table components and why it's
so important that we have it is say you
have a table component here. Okay, let's
call this table. And we know that's like
Oops, I'm sorry. I'm going to create the
component of this. And we know that not
every column is going to need like the
same width. Okay, some columns might
need to have a longer width for a longer
description. Some might need a shorter
width. And the only way to adjust that
like is to kind of like break the
component. Okay, we're going to need an
easy way to do this though. And that's
where we introduced the idea of adjust
gap. So, what we're going to do is, if
you're going to recall during um some of
our earlier components, we had this
concept where we could adjust the gap in
order to adjust the width without having
to break the component. We're going to
bring in that same concept here. Let's
set the gap to something like 12. Make
sure this is set to hug. And then
select, let's call this adjust gap. And
then set both these to zero and zero.
Okay. The width and height to zero. And
then what we can do is take your adjust
gap and place it inside of the column
component. Now you're going to notice
that it just sort of goes all the way to
the top there. And let's just be sure to
left align that.
So now on uh any of these table cells,
sorry, we're going we're going to go
down here to our an instance of like a
what is like a table component. You can
see here on the layers and I don't think
my my face is covering it. So no, I
think you can see it. Okay. How we can
see adjust gap. If I was to set this to
something like um 200, right? It's going
to extend beyond. But what we can do is
we can use hug
in order to bring all these elements out
and then just set each of these to fill.
So now what we what we essentially did
is we adjusted the width of the column
without see there's a great example
without needing to break the component.
Okay. So that if you're if you show this
in an interview, you have the job. Okay,
like this is super like complex level of
componentry. Genius level stuff if I'm
honest. Okay,
so let's call this our column table or
column table. And let's just add a bunch
more cells rows here. You know,
standard's 1440. So I can see this is
set to 1040 as like a width of a table.
I think that's like pretty good in the
grand scheme of things. Okay, so there's
our column table. One thing we can also
do as well is uh this can also be a dot
column table because one thing we might
also want to do is add like a table
header like call this um my advisors or
something my advisers where we set this
to like uh I don't know maybe like an H5
or an H
whatever that works uh and set this to
our text headings and we can add some
auto layout between these to kind of
have like this. What's the word that I'm
looking for? Like a heading for what
this data is to represent. Okay. So, we
can maybe set this to something like 24.
There we go. I think we're in some
decent shape. Um, yeah, I think things
are looking pretty good. One thing we
might also want to add here is, um, so
I'm trying to think here. So, let's go
ahead and add in a stroke actually. So,
a border border default one pixel on the
outside. Okay. So, just to clean up some
of that data. And we might also even
want to add in a quick radius. Set it to
something like eight. There we go. So,
this is your dot column table. This
might be your your your column table.
Column table. But I'm not going to
create the component of this just yet
because one thing we might also want to
do is combine both like our column table
and also our row table together. Uh, and
then we can add properties for in order
to like hide like that table header,
change the table header, and all that
fun stuff as well. So let's create our
actually our row table first before we
join these together as components. Okay.
So now let's work on our row. So what
we're going to do is let's just bring
some of our cells here and just place
them side by side. And it looks like we
have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and then eight going
across. So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 then 8. Set the
gap to zero. And let's call this our dot
row. And this should be our dot column.
Dot column. There we go. And one thing
I'm also noticing here too is these are
all 130 in width. So let's maintain some
level of consistency and just set each
of these to 130.
Okay. And we can't have a just gap for
our rows. It's just doesn't really work
that way. Okay. So let's go ahead and
create the component of this now. So
there we have our row. So just as we
used our row our column to build our
column table, we're going to do the same
thing. So uh I see we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
8 9 10 plus headings. So we'll do the
same. So 11 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and then 10
and then 11 here at the top for the
headings. And let's make this our
headings.
There we go. So there we have our dot
row uh table. Okay. And then let's do
the same as we did above. So border uh
default uh one pixel on the outside. Set
the radius to eight.
There we go. There we have uh our row
table. Now, if we think about um our row
table and also our column table is one
thing I'm actually debating that might
make sense for us to actually do is
maybe swap out use these as actually
um so I was to detach these. Oops. If I
was to detach these, delete these core
components. And what I'm actually going
to do is I'm going to combine these into
one component set. So now we have our
table type,
our table type, our table type where we
have our column component. So our type
where we have our column component and
then we have our row table. So we have
our column and our row
column and row that we can swap out in
between. So what this actually allows us
to do then is if we have a specific like
look that we go for for our tables and
let's look at like an example of what
that might look like. So say if we have
like a heading here which is like uh my
advisors or our advisors.
Okay. And we set this to
like H4. Okay. And make sure that this
is set to our headings.
Okay. Let's group these together. Add
some auto layout. Uh maybe just on this
side actually where we set this to
something like 12 and 12. Okay. And now
on the outer frame maybe we might want
to add a stroke. So on the outside
which is a border you know default
something like that. And we can maybe
even just like reduce the gap to 12. Say
if there's a certain look for although
this does look a little bit messy about
like 24 by 24 or s certain look that
you're going for like maybe if I also
bring in like some buttons
like some buttons here uh place them at
the end you know maybe it's like a
download as an example we swap this out
for like a download
uh like a download export to excel like
that kind of thing okay is you can also
create like this bar as a component.
We're not going to do that now. So now
you what you can do is you can have your
table component. But inside your table
component, if you turn on those nested
instances, if you turn on those nested
instances, what it's going to allow you
to do is actually just swap between the
column table and the row table depending
on what your data use case is. Okay, so
I know table components can be a little
bit confusing. So there's a lot of like
options that you can do with your table
component, but if you were to set up a
table component, that is exactly how I
would do it. Okay, make sure that's set
to our text headings, which it is.
Beautiful. So there you have a table
component. Sweet. So now it's actually
time to publish the design system now.
So to publish it, like what it means to
publish a design system, it's basically
like, okay, you're now ready to have
other people consume this design system.
That's basically what that's saying.
Okay, if the design system is not
published, then people cannot use it.
Only those within the file can use it.
So, in order to publish a design system,
hit that little dropown and hit publish
library. Now, yeah, Figma make I hate
how they have ads for it everywhere is
one thing I'd like to call out here is
that this you can only publish if you're
on in like a paid like Figma team space.
Okay. Um I am in one. You can tell how
it says like a team name like right
there in like the top left. Anyways, so
what essentially it's going to do when
you publish a library for the very first
time, like it's basically going to give
you everything including all of your
icons. And because I have like thousands
of icons here, like I'm also going to
publish those, too. So, it's going to
take a while. This here is where you can
go through and just confirm that all
like the components that you want to
publish have been published or you can
just choose to unpublish them, unpublish
ones that should not have been published
uh at a later date. Um, but anyway, so
let's go ahead and publish this library
and it's going to take like 10 or 15
minutes. So, I'm going to go ahead and
pause the video. So, as you can see
here, I had hit publish and now the
library itself is actually publishing.
So, because I have so many icon
components and there's so many icon
variants, it's not just publishing like
the components, it's publishing all the
variants associated with it. And if we
go into like the material UI icon set,
like each of the icons have like four
variants with them. So, that's just why
it's taking so long. Um, it's one of
those things you just got to stay tight
with. Okay. So now that our design
system has stopped um publishing or
stopped yeah stopped publishing now it's
ready to subscribe to. Now in or if
you're in that team folder okay you can
subscribe to that design system. Now in
order to subscribe to that design system
what you're going to do is up under this
Figma thing here. So hit the Figma icon
and then go down to libraries. And then
what it's going to do is that so right
away here you can see that there's no
changes inside of this no changes to
this current design system. Okay. So
nothing has been changed. All of these
components again this where it's going
to show you where all these components
that have been published and you can
select which ones to to also unpublish
or republish. Okay. As you make changes,
you can republish the design system and
it's only going to show the components
that have been changed for you to
republish. Okay, which is nice. And then
what you're going to want to do is you
can go through teams or UI kits. Both
ways work uh to really just I won't do
that because and I have a ton of like
other design systems that I can't show
um under teams and UI kits. So in order
to do that, you would just find the one
and then just hit hit subscribe. It
really is super simple. and and what in
that file you would then have access to
this design system. So it's really a
straightforward approach uh in order to
make changes and like republish. Let me
just give you a quick example here. If
we were to set this radius to like four.
Okay. And then uh oops wrong one. Let's
go to publish this library. Notice how
it's only going to show you the button.
And I made changes to the table like
when we weren't looking. I was just
playing around with it. So that's why
it's showing that. So now how it's
showing you everything that's unchanged,
hidden, and also the components that are
available to to republish where you can
toggle them on and off. So design system
management, it really is a simple simple
thing. And just like that, there you
have all the components you need to get
your design system started. So let's
rock and roll. Hey, thanks for watching.
Um, and quite frankly making it this
far. Um, if you want to watch a video, I
highly recommend you can click right
there. It goes through a little bit more
of like an advanced design system setup.
