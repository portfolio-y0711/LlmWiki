# How I use Claude Code for real engineering

What's up, friends? Uh, we're going to
do a little bit of a different kind of
video. I've been working a lot with
Claude Code recently. I've been getting
a lot of questions on how I use it. And
so, I just sat down to do a little bit
of work and I realized this is actually
a really good opportunity to show a
complicated multi-phase plan with Claude
Code. The only thing I've done so far is
I've written this prompt here. I'm doing
a bit of work to add a CLI command to an
internal CLI that I have to do with my
AI hero courses. But what I'm doing is
less important than how I'm doing it.
All you really need to know is this is a
pretty large feature that will go
probably beyond a single context window.
I have here an initial prompt that I've
put in. I haven't really put too much
thought into this. The way I produced
this was I just talked into my
microphone and used a dictation tool to
dictate it in. And I've also activated
plan mode here by tabbing or shift
tabbing through until I hit plan mode in
the bottom left. Whenever I embark out
on a big piece of work, I'm always
thinking about creating a plan first.
Let's get this running. and I can
actually talk through while it's going.
So this plan is basically is sort of
forcing Claude code to explore the
codebase first. We can see it's kicked
off an explore sub agent task to explore
the current CLI structure in the
codebase. It's also doing some searching
here, just searching different files,
searching different patterns. And what
I'm waiting for it to do is to figure
out anything that's unclear from my
specification and give me back some sort
of plan. Again, we can see it's doing a
lot of stuff here. It's reading
different files. It's doing some other
stuff. Let me check the structure for
explainer solution folders. And now this
is really cool. It's come back with some
clarifying questions. What is the part
of the project repo where you want to
get commit diffs from? I'm going to make
it a CLI option. I just pressed return
to choose that one. It's asking whether
I wanted to use a positional argument or
a required option. I'm going to choose a
required option. And it's now asking me
a really specific question about my
implementation like should it match
exercise numbers strictly or flexibly?
I'll choose flexible. And again, it's
asking a clarifying question here. What
does the 01 represent? It represents the
sequence of the diff. This is basically
a multi-step form and then I end up with
the submit. I'm ready to submit my
answers. Let's go. All right. It has now
come back with a plan. Now, this plan
might look a little bit different from
the plans that you tend to get from
Claude code. The first thing is it's
extremely concise. Here we have a fair
few sections, but the stuff inside those
sections is pretty easy to read. This is
because I have this configured like that
in my rules, which we'll look at in a
moment. We have a new file, get
diffs.ts, ts and in updated file that
seems fine and it's created some
implementation steps here too. The
crucial thing though and I have this set
up in my rules too is it's given me some
unresolved questions and I get to choose
whether I want to auto accept the edits
uh manually approve the edits or keep
planning. I'm going to escape out of
this for now just so I can show you
what's in my rules file. You can call
this command memory and you can
basically be taken to your user memory
or project memory. This is what my user
memory looks like. It's really not very
long, only about 43 lines. I've given it
just some very light hints about what I
want. The crucial thing though is to say
in all interactions and commit messages,
be extremely concise and sacrifice
grammar for the sake of concision.
That's why that plan is so concise and
easy to read is because of this topline
rule. And it's 100% my favorite thing
I've added to rules and I'm never taking
it out. There's some stuff in here
that's specific to my workflow like PR
comments, like change sets as well,
which I use in quite a few repos. I've
already said that your primary method
for interacting with GitHub should be
the GitHub CLI. When creating branches,
prefix them with Matt to indicate they
came from me. Very, very light stuff,
but here's the one we're seeing here,
which is at the end of each plan, give
me a list of unresolved questions to
answer, if any, and again, make the
questions extremely concise. Sacrifice
grammar for the sake of concision. This
is why then we're getting this list of
unresolved questions right at the point
where we can see them. So, I'm now going
to dictate my answers to these questions
into this box. I'll just do the first
question just so you get the idea. Yep,
you can overwrite existing diff files.
That's absolutely fine. And thanks to my
dictation tool, this ends up there.
Okay, I've now got my full answers to
those questions. Let's submit it. And
it's going to continue creating another
plan. Notice how we haven't written any
code yet. This is all just planning
before we dive into code. Okay, it's now
given me a plan without any unresolved
questions. But my Spidey senses are
tingling here. And I've got a feeling
this is a pretty large piece of work.
And if this piece of work is too large,
it's going to overrun the context window
of the LLM. It's going to be much better
going forward if I break this into a
multi-phase plan that I can split over
multiple context windows. So, I'm
actually going to say no, keep planning,
and then make the plan multi-phase. Make
the plan multihase is really, really
nice because it's going to tell Claude
to break this down into a set of
implementation steps. And now we have
our multi-phase plan. Beautiful. Now, at
this point, I'm starting to get a little
bit nervous about my context window.
Like, that's a paranoia that I have. And
I'm just going to go and exit out of
there and just check my context and see
how it's doing. We can see that so far
we have 83.7 free space. That's feeling
pretty good. We've only used about 33k
tokens. Lovely. So I think having had
all the exploration and now having this
plan in memory, we can then start
executing the plan. So I'm going to swap
to autoaccedit and I'm going to say uh
execute phase one. Let's go. Okay, we've
had our first little paper cut which is
it still thinks it's in plan mode. I
just say crack on please with phase one.
Lovely stuff. While it's doing its
thing, we should talk about this little
status line down the bottom. I have this
customized so it shows which repo I'm in
relative to my repos folder. It also
shows which branch I'm on and how many
staged, unstaged, and new files I have
inside the current repo. It's already
asking me to build the project. That's a
good sign. And I'm going to say yes and
don't ask again for PNPM build commands.
I'm not going to review it as it's
going. I'm just going to review it ah
when it gets to the end. So, what I want
to do now is open it up in VS Code to
have a look at the files and just see if
there's anything I need to tweak. I'm
actually going to exit out of Claude
here by pressing control C twice. I'm
just going to run code dot. And now I do
want to get Claude back into this
terminal. So, I'm just going to say
Claude continue. And Claude will now
pick up our conversation where we left
off. It's a really nice little flow if
you just want to X out of Claude, run a
CLI command, and then go back. So, now I
can just use the, you know, standard git
diff viewer that we're all used to just
to see what's going on here. I can see
that it's added get diffs.js. That's
nice. And it's added this to internal.
There is a TypeScript error there, but
shocker, it was actually there before.
And I'm not entirely sure how to fix it,
and I can't be asked. You can also see
it's left in here a to-do for phase 2,
which is really nice. It means that when
we go to phase 2, we actually have a
hint in the code where it's going to
execute it. So, this all looks good.
What I like to do is either commit these
changes or just stage them so it's
really clear between phases what's been
added. If we go back to Claude, let's
have a quick check on context. Yeah,
phase one only used like 3k tokens. So,
we can absolutely crack on with phase
two and I'm going to leave it accept
edit on. Now that we've done the
planning, we can be pretty aggressive
with accept edits on because we
understand the implementation a bit and
we kind of get what's going on. Phase
two is complete and I'm reviewing it and
it looks pretty nice. A quick check on
context. We are in a very healthy place.
Let's do phase three, please. Something
I really wish that Claude code would add
is to just add the amount of tokens that
I've used so that I can put it in my
status line. That would mean I wouldn't
need to keep running context. I would
just have it right there, which is
something that cursor does really really
well actually. So phase three is
complete and what I accidentally did was
went into the file and pressed save and
an auto formatter ran and it did a
little couple of changes. When that
accidentally happens, the claw code
doesn't know anything about it. So I do
like to tell it and being very direct
with it as well. pull the files into
your context. And note how it in
followed my instructions really well. It
didn't do anything. It just literally
read a file again. So, our context is in
a pretty healthy place. And I'm pretty
sure we're going to be able to get to
the end of this feature without actually
needing to reset the context window. But
I want to show you what it's like when
you do reset the context window. The
cool thing about having a multi-phase
plan is that we can preserve it between
different context windows and the LLM
should have all the information it needs
to carry it on. But the question is
where do we actually store it? Do we put
it in a local file or do we do something
else with it? What I like to do is
actually keep these as GitHub issues and
I've said to it make a GitHub issue
containing the current plan including
all of the items that you've checked off
the plan list. This is calling GH issue
create with this plan in the description
of the issue. Everything's been checked
off for all of these phases except for
phase four and five. I'm happy with this
so I'll accept this. And now that I have
this asset outside of my context window,
I can feel happy clearing it. And this
means if I run context now, we now have
virtually nothing in the context window.
No messages whatsoever. We're down to
16K tokens just from our memory files,
the system tools, and the system prompt.
So I'm now going to ask it get the
GitHub issue 24 and enact phase 4 of
that plan. Now I'm deciding in my head,
do I want to go for accept edits on or
do I want to go for plan mode? because
plan mode basically forces it to do a
little bit of exploration and the
exploration might be necessary because
we've completely cleared out the
context. I think though I'm going to go
for accept edits on and basically just
get it to take the information from the
plan and get going. You can see it's
asking to view an issue and I'm happy to
say don't ask again. Issues are fine to
view. Okay, it hasn't done so much
planning or like codebase exploration
here, but it has read the correct file
and it's now implementing the correct
stuff, I think. Yep, that's actually
looking really nice. Let's now do phase
five. And of course, because it's
already fetched the GitHub issue, it
doesn't need to fetch it again. It's
still just in the context window. So
this process then of splitting work into
phases is really, really important. You
don't have to put each phase into a
separate context window. You can do as
many phases as you like, checking the
context window as you go. And I really
like keeping these assets in the cloud
because then actually people can comment
on them, add stuff overnight, add stuff
async. And I find this flow is a really
nice combination of letting the AI go
and do its work on accept mode and
having a lot of upfront thinking, doing
lots of thought via planning. And this
is currently how I'm doing all of my
coding, not only for AI hero stuff, but
also for Everite. And I think my top
tips are make sure that in your memory
file you have a tip to be extremely
concise. Get it to produce unresolved
questions at the end of each plan. And
get it to use the GitHub CLI to create
issues so you can share context across
multiple context windows. Thanks for
watching. This ended up being a pretty
chunky video and I will see you in the
next one.
