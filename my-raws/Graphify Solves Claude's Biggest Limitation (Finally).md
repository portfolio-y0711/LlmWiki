# Graphify Solves Claude's Biggest Limitation (Finally)

If you're using large language model,
here's how you do research on your
project, then you definitely need to
check out this repository called
Graphify. And this repository is
inspired from this ex post that Andrej
Karpathy wrote about the LM knowledge
base. And for those who don't know who
Andrej Karpathy is, he is the former
director of AI at Tesla and a founding
member of OpenAI. And essentially what
he's saying here is that we can index
our raw file here to make a large
language model here to query information
and also be able to maintain it. And
this repository here, you can see it
does exactly that. For example, let's
say if you have a folder here that
contains code, documentations, you
simply just using the Graphify command
scale and it's going to convert it into
a knowledge graph. And once you convert
that into a knowledge graph, this will
reduce the large language model token
usage by 70%. So instead of having AI
agent here to reading the raw files or
documentations every single time,
Graphify here is going to index it for
you and compiles your code base into a
structured knowledge graph so that the
large language model here is going to be
much more faster, consumes less tokens,
and much more accurate when finding
information from your local folders
because it's already creating a graph.
And honestly, this is mostly for people
who wants to read more than write,
especially for doing research or
exploring new code bases. And that's why
in this video, we're going to explore
this Graphify repository and we're going
to see how we can be able to install
this onto a local machine, how we can be
able to use it like converting our raw
files here into a knowledge graph, and
later on I'm going to show exactly how
we can be able to add any informations,
how we can query informations, how we
can be able to add this to different
large language model, extracting
documentations, and so much more. So by
the end of this video, your large
language model here can have higher
accuracy, lower token consumptions, and
faster output. So with that being said,
if that sounds interesting, let's get
into the video. Now, before we continue,
I recently launched our school community
where I help you to master AI agents,
automations, and so much more. And
that's all coming from someone who used
to work as a senior AI software engineer
at companies like Amazon and Microsoft.
And in this community, you're going to
get over 100 plus video materials like
templates and workflows that I
personally built and sold over 100 plus
times. On top of that, you're also going
to get access to our weekly live calls.
And just give you an idea, this week
we're actually running a Claude
Masterclass where we're going to dive
into how to improve Claude's accuracy
when we're going to use it to build the
applications. Plus, you're also going to
get full community support where you're
going to get a chance to ask questions
and get direct answers back. So, if
you're ready to level up, make sure you
jump right in and I'll see you in a
community. All right. So, to get
started, first we're going to do here is
to install the prerequisites. So, right
here you can see there's a couple of
things we need. One is we need the
Python onto your local machine, which is
version 3.10 above. And simply just
going to go to the python.org and just
going to install it onto your local
machine. The other one here is we have
is UV. And we can also use the PIPX, but
I'm just going to use UV for now. So,
essentially we can do here is that you
can just copy the repository and paste
it to Claude Code or Codex and try to
have your AI agent here to install it on
your behalf. But, I'm just going to
install this manually here so you can
see here the first one we need to is to
install the Python and UV onto your Mac
OS. So, simply I'm just going to head
over to a new terminal session, paste
that command, and you can see it's going
to install Python here and UV onto our
local machine. And the next thing I'm
going to do here, as you can see, we're
going to use UV here to install the
Graphile. Now, UV is kind of like NPM
for uh Python, right? So, instead of
having Node.js, which is using NPM,
Python here is using UV. So, now if I
were to clear terminal and just going to
do the install for Graphile, and now you
can see it's going to install the
Graphile NPM or in this case the package
onto our local machine. And then what's
going to happen here is that we're going
to register skills with our AI assistant
by simply just going to run the Graphile
install.
This way we're going to have our skills
added onto our project, which you can
see here. So, we have our skill
installed and also it's going to be
living in this .claude folder. And then
we also have the claude.md file, which
rows on how to use the skill. And of
course, if you're using different
platforms, by default the installation
here is going to install claw code, but
if you're using code x, you can simply
just going to do the platform code x. If
you're using open code, there's also a
command for that and open claw as well
as the Hermes agents. So, there's tons
of options if you're using different AI
agents framework, so you can just follow
that as well. Okay, so once we have this
installed, the next thing we're going to
take a look at is the commands. So, we
scroll all the way down, you can see
there's a common commands where we
simply just going to do the graph by
dots and it's going to build a graph for
the current folder. Now, like I said,
this is the bookkeeping application that
I built. These are tons of folders that
we have, tons of MD files or code files
that we have here. And this is basically
the platform that I built, which is book
zero.ai and essentially what this
platform does is using AI to help
businesses here to manage receipts and
bank statements. And here you can see
there's bunch of code base, which has
the app, the assets, the components, the
content, docs, and so much more. And
essentially, all I had to do here just
going to do the {slash} graph by dots.
And what's going to happen here is that
it's going to take the current folder
that we have, which is huge, huge code
base, and I'm just going to do a {slash}
graph by dots. And it's going to build a
knowledge graph around this code base.
So, in this case, what I'm going to do
here is I'm going to wait for a bit
until everything is set up. And then
we're going to take a look at what the
result look like. Okay, so now you can
see it's asking us a question. In terms
of the full map that we're trying to
build, right, the full knowledge graph,
should we only process the code only or
the code plus documentations but skip
images or the full extractions including
the images. So, you can see that if we
were to do the full extractions, that's
going to take anywhere around 200k all
the way to 400k tokens. But depends on
what you're trying to do. If you're
doing like research on the code base for
existing functionalities, then my
recommendation is just the first option,
which is code only. If you're looking to
go through the documentation as well,
you can also do with the second option.
But if images are anywhere that help you
to do the research, then you can also do
the full extraction as configured as
well. But for my case here, I'm going to
go with something that's much more
quicker and just do the code only
instead. So, in this case, I'm going to
choose that option for now. Okay, so
finally, you can see the graph here is
fully generated and it has generated
three things. One is the graph.html,
which is an interactive knowledge graph
that we can interact it with it, which
I'll show you later on this video. And
there's also the graph.reports,
as well as the graph.json, which is
basically the raw JSON for the graph
data. So, there you can see we have uh
70,000 for nodes and 33 for the edges.
So, edges is basically the connection
between the nodes and nodes are
basically the individual files or
individual components that we have. And
you can see that for the token cost
here, this is how much it cost, and this
is the benchmark. So, roughly, you can
see we're saving 25 or sorry, 27 times
token reductions for any questions that
we're going to ask to large language
model about our code base. So, this is
the impact that we have here. And you
can see that these are the got nodes.
Got nodes are basically the edges that
we have. They're basically the edge
nodes that we have inside our graph. So,
kind of like the children nodes, right?
The which is which don't have any
children itself. Uh furthermore, you can
see these are the surprising
connections, the suggested questions,
and furthermore, you can see there's a
bunch of stuff that it has find. And
what we're going to do here is I'm going
to navigate to the HTML, and you can see
that this is the entire knowledge graph.
I can simply just going to toggle on or
off or just like let's say if I want to
I'm very interested about the admin
layouts, I can just toggle everything
off and just show the admin layouts and
the API routes, and I can be able to see
all the edges, all the graph, all the
nodes that are connected to that
relations. And by doing so, this way is
much more easier for me to understand
the connections for all the files, all
the code that we have in our code base.
And this will help me to understand or
speed up the process to make me
understand the code base here much more
faster. And furthermore, if I were to
head over to the repository back really
quickly, you can see that there's couple
functionality that we can trigger. So,
for example, there's one functionality
called path. For example, let's say if I
want to know the path between two files
or two functionalities that we have. One
is the admin panel and the other one is
AI chat. And you can see here that it's
going to trigger the graphify here. And
by the end of it, you can see it's going
to show us the shortest path between
those two connections. So, one is the
admin panel and the other one is AI
chat. So, you can see that these are the
files that I jump through, right? To see
from going from the layout for the admin
all the way to the AI page. And you can
see that the connection between the two
is actually from the index.ts, which is
a file that calling both of those
layouts or both of those TX files,
right? So, you can see that's exactly
the connection between the two. And here
is the shortest path. And furthermore,
there's also another functionality
called explain. Like, let's say if I
don't know the rate limiting or how does
the AI chat functionality works in our
application, right? So, for example, I
wanted to ask and say, "Hey, let me Why
don't you explain to me the inbound and
outbound inside of our admin console."
And you can see it's going to look
through that and it's going to try to
explain to you the concept based on the
knowledge graph. And you can see this is
the answer that it has found. So, the
inbound versus the outbound and the main
admin here, this is the dashboard and
split by two sides of the sign-up they
measure. So, one is the outbound
analytics, which is where the visitor
come from and where they drop off. The
inbound here you can see is what users
do after the sign-up and where they
charm. So, you can see this is the
entire difference between two and where
they split. And you can see it gives you
a clear definition of how it works. And
furthermore, you can see there's also
the query where let's say if you have
any questions, you can also put your
question here and ask about it, right?
Let's say if you want to also adding
additional, for example, information.
Like, for example, I want to add a
research paper onto this graph. I can
also do that. But let's just say that
you have added bunch of stuff. Let's say
if you want to re-restructure only the
changed files that you have. Let's Let's
if you modify some files here on your
local machine, you have a bunch of
files, not just one, not just two, but
like actually like 10 or 20. Instead of
just adding them one by one, what you
can also do here is that you can also do
graph 5.raw {hyphen} {hyphen} update,
which will re-extract only the changed
files and add them onto your knowledge
base. And that's how you can do it.
There's also the Obsidian, which is
really cool. Like you can also be able
to generate the Obsidian vaults based on
your code base. So for example, like
let's say if you're interested about the
docs that you have, I'm going to do this
really quickly. So I'm just going to go
to a new terminal and do the cloud
again. And I'm just going to do the
graph 5 here for the Obsidian. And this
time I'm going to say I'm only
interested for doing this inside for our
doc folder. So I only want you to touch
what we have in our docs folder, which
is this path right here, and I want you
to do this. So you can also be able to
give it a prompt and let it try to do
the Obsidian parts for the docs folder.
So if you don't want to do this for the
entire code base, you can also do this
for the entire doc folder. You can put
in that. And just mention that I want
you to generate a Obsidian vault for
this, right? So there's a lot of things
you can do. There's also wiki, there's
also SVG,
um there's Neo, Neo for J, if you want
to generate a like a rag system, right?
So there's a lot of things you can do.
There's also like you can generate a MCP
server for this. So that any other large
language model here can query for this.
There's also a option for you to do
that. So honestly here you can see the
possibility here is endless, and I don't
want to go over this in video, but you
can see the core functionality here is
you can use this to query information,
to extract informations, to show the
connection between the two, to help you
to understand the code base here much
more faster. And I'll make sure to drop
this repository here in the links in the
description below for you to check it
out. And don't forget, if you're looking
to up your level on how you can use
Claude code or any other coding agent
here to develop applications, because we
do have courses and also weekly live
calls that you can check it out. So with
that being said, that you do find value
